      <abstract>This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper manuscript map entitled: Plan of the town and basin of Quebec : and part of the adjacent country shewing the principal encampments and works of the British army commanded by Major Genl. Wolfe and those of the French army by Lieut. Genl. the Marquis of Montcalm during the attack in 1759. Scale [ca. 1:9,600]. This image consists of images of a two sheet source map that have been stitched together using image editing software to create one image. 

Manuscript copy of a map. Copied by [Whlkington?] in 1857.

The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 19N NAD 1983 coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map.

This map shows features such as roads, drainage, selected buildings, fortification, ship and troop movements, and places of military interest for the Battle of Quebec, 1759, and more. Relief is shown by hachures. Includes index and text.

This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project.  Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods.  These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.</abstract>
      <purpose>Historic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred in the cultural and physical landscape.  The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change.  As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>The georeferenced raster is a faithfully reproduced digital image of the original source map. Some differences may be detected between the source graphic used and the raster image due to the RGB values assigned that particular color. The intent is to recreate those colors as near as possible.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <complete>Data completeness for raster digital image files reflect content of the source graphic. Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic due to scale and legibility constraints</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The horizontal positional accuracy of a raster image is approximately the same as the accuracy of the published source map.  The lack of a greater accuracy is largely the result of the inaccuracies with the original measurements and possible distortions in the original paper map document.  There may also be errors introduced during the digitizing and georeferencing process.  For instance, this raster image was georeferenced to another georeferenced image, which may have its own positional inaccuracies (see "Process Steps").  Also, since this image is compiled from two source images, positional error may have been introduced in the image stitching process.  In most cases, however, errors in the raster image are small compared with sources of error in the original map graphic.  The RMS error for this image is 102.52221 meters.  This value describes how consistent the transformation is between the different control points (links).  The RMS error is only an assessment of the accuracy of the transformation.</horizpar>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Production of this raster image began with the scanning of the paper map on a high-resolution scanner: (Betterlight, Super8K2 scanning back camera and ViewFinder 5.x capture software).  Maps were photographed at a copy stand. A vacuum easel was used to keep the maps flat during photography. The imaging specification was designed to produce detailed "Archival Master" images that, to the extent possible, are faithful reproductions of the originals, and that allow for highly detailed screen reproduction and print reproduction at up 1:1. Images in this collection were processed using Adobe Photoshop.  Color and tonal corrections were made using Adobe Photoshop. Image files were viewed on a calibrated monitor. Editing was performed in an ISO 3664 compliant proofing environment. Master Image files were corrected and archived as TIFF files in the sRGB IEC611966-2.1 color-space. When possible files were batch processed using an "action" script derived from edits applied to match a representative sample. This image consists of two original images that have been stitched together using Adobe Photoshop.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Using ArcMap 9.2 software, the digital TIFF image was georeferenced to common points located on the following scanned, georeferenced topographic map(s): Quebec 21L/14b Edition 2; Montmorency 21L/14g Edition 1; and Ville-Guay 14L/14a Edition 1 from the 1:25,000 topographic series published in the early 1960's by the Canadian Army Service Establishment R.C.E.  These topographic quadrangles were scanned at 300 dpi and then georeferenced in the NAD 1927 UTM 19N coordinate system to the four corner sets of latitude, latitude tic marks.  The RMS error for [Quebec 21L/14b] is 2.26582 meters; for [Montmorency 21L/14g] is 3.46332 meters; and for [Ville-Guay 14L/14a] is 1.96974 meters.
The digital TIFF image of the historic map was subsequently georeferenced in the NAD 1983 UTM 19N coordinate system.  A world file (.tfwx) and an .aux.xml file were automatically generated and saved in association with the digital TIFF image. See 'Horizontal Accuracy' for the RMS error of this specific TIFF.  

Please note that the projection will need to be defined by the user in order to display the image with other projected data and the world file will need to be stored in the same root directory as the image.</procdesc>

    <overview>
      <eaover>The indexes reference a color palette of RGB values from 0 through 255, representing the color value from the original paper sheet map. The colors on that sheet can represent relief, drainage, vegetation, populated places, cultural features, coastal hydrography, transportation features (roads, railroads, tracks and trails), spot elevations and boundaries. The colors are sometimes explained in a legend that is incorporated into the map inset or collar.</eaover>
