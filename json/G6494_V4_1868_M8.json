Bonhammer; lith inst. F. Koke in Wien. It was published by L. T. Neumann in [1868]. Scale [ca. 1:11,500]. Map in German. Covers Vienna, Austria. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the MGI 3-Degree Gauss Kruger coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads and stations, drainage, built-up areas and selected buildings, fortification, ground cover, parks, city districts, and more. Includes index and inset: Umgebung von Wien. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
