  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: London surveyed, or, a new map of the cities of London and Westminster and the borough of Southwark : shewing the several streets and lanes with the most of the alleys & thorough fairs with the additional new buildings to this present year 1742. It was printed for John Bowles at the Black Horse in Cornhill in 1742. Scale [ca. 1:5,280]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the British National Grid coordinate system (British National Grid, Airy Spheroid OSGB (1936) Datum). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, drainage, selected buildings (some shown pictorially), built-up areas, docks, city district boundaries, and more. Relief is shown pictorially. Includes illustrations, tables of fares, and views: South prospect of London -- North prospect of St. Paul's Cathedral -- Bank of England -- Front of the Royal Exchange -- Banqueting House -- Treasury. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
