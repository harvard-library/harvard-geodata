        <procdesc>Digitized place names from the 1970 National Atlas of the United States were compared with Bureau of Census Place names from the Codes for Named Populated Places (FIPS 55-DC3).  Where there were discrepancies, names from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) were used. A small number of places could not be assigned FIPS-55-DC3 codes and were removed from the data set. Minor positional corrections were also made.</procdesc>
