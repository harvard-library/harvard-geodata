    <logic>No duplicate features are present.  The shapefile is exported using Avenue request ExportClean.  This request verifies and enforces the correctness of shapes.</logic>
    <complete>After processing, the data set is checked for drawing display and number of records and file sizes compared with source materials.  Some of the cartographic problems with this data inherent in the original 1:100,000 USGS Topographic Quadrangle source data remain in that the density of features can change abruptly.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was extracted from the 1990 Census Version TIGER/Line(tm) files (CD-ROM edition). The positional accuracy of the TIGER/Line coordinates at best meets the established National Map Accuracy standards (+/- 167 feet approximately) for the 1:100,000-scale source maps from the USGS. The level of positional accuracy in the TIGER/Line files is not suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.</horizpar>
