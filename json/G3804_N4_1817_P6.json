  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Plan of the city of New-York : the greater part from actual survey made expressly for the purpose (the rest from authentic documents), by Thos. H. Poppleton, city surveyor ; P. Maverick sc.. It was published by Prior & Dunning in 1817. Scale [ca. 1:7,300].

Includes key to places of interest. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
