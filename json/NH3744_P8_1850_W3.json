It was published in 1850 by C.W. Brewster. Scale 1:3,960. Covers Portsmouth, New Hampshire, including Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and portion of Kittery, Maine. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the New Hampshire State Plane Coordinate System (Feet) (FIPS 2800). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, drainage, school districts, selected buildings labeled with owners' names, wharves, cemeteries, and more.
