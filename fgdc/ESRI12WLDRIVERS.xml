        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by Esri for Data &amp; Maps 2002: Downloaded Sea of Aral image from  http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/data/ev89/ev8936_AralSea.A2001165.0710.250m.jpg.  Locally registered the image to the vector data using ArcView GIS Image Analysis creating shapefiles of the current water area.  These shapefiles were used as the basis for updating the current extent of the rivers leading to the sea. Copied ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), ArcView GIS legend file (.avl), and projection file (.prj) and created spatial indices.The following steps were performed by Esri: Extracted the features from ArcWorld 1:25M.  Aligned the mouths of rivers with coastlines. Made features consistent with all political boundaries they are coincident with.  Added attribute values from the Rand McNally New International Atlas, the Times Atlas of the World, the Digital Chart of the World, and World Resources Institute.  Added St. Lawrence system from ArcWorld 1:3M.  Generalized to match detail of the Cntry00.shp. Removed unneeded attributes. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr).  Created ArcView GIS legend file (.avl).  Created projection file (.prj).  Ran ArcView GIS Avenue? request ExportClean, and created spatial indices.</procdesc>
