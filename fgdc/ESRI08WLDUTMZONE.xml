Chose UTM Areas (utm_ply.shp) and added attributes East_value, Cm_value, and West_value from UTM zones (zone.shp).  Added filler values to attributes of the polygons in the north and south polar areas.  Removed unneeded attributes.  Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr).  Created projection file (.prj).  Ran ArcView GIS Avenue? request ExportClean, and created spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Adjusted UTM grid cells to fit two newly sized areas in Norway and Svalbard. The three original cells (32X, 34X, and 36X) no longer exist, having been absorbed by their adjacent cells in the row. The cell 32V absorbed the eastern half of cell 31V. Edited attributes WEST_VALUE, CM_VALUE, and EAST_VALUE for the affected grid cells. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>

With few exceptions, they divide the world into sixty zones, each of which is six degrees of longitude wide. The zones are numbered from 1 through 60 eastward from 180 degrees longitude. The zone characters designate eight degrees of latitude high rows extending north and south from the equator with the exception of the northern-most row which is 12 degrees high.</enttypd>
