  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays a point coverage for traffic monitoring stations throughout Massachusetts. Traffic counts, taken regularly at selected locations, show Route 128 to be the most heavily-traveled route in the region. The volumes are especially high on Route 3 and Interstate 95 (to the south), between Rt. 20 and I-93 (to the northwest) and along I-93 extending north toward New Hampshire. Lower volumes are shown for I-495 and much of I-93. Annual traffic growth has long exceeded population growth because of continued suburban sprawl, the increase of women in the labor force and rising household incomes. (Comparison of traffic counts with capacity is necessary for measuring congestion). Traffic volumes in the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) region are provided for 1996. This dataset was originally prepared and distributed by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council. It was published as part of the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database in 2001. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library. The Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) is a regional planning agency representing 101 cities and towns in the metropolitan Boston area. Created by an act of the Legislature in 1963, it serves as a forum for state and local officials to address issues of regional importance. As one of 14 members of the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), MAPC has oversight responsibility for the region's federally funded transportation program Stretching west from Boston to include most of the communities inside the I-495 corridor, the MAPC planning area consists of 22 cities and 79 towns. Coastal communities, older industrial centers, rural towns, and modern cities are represented within the 1,422 square miles that comprise the MAPC region.",
