      <abstract>This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Cambridgshire : described with the deuision of the hundreds, the townes situation, with the armes of the colleges of that famous vniuersiti and also the armes of all such princes and noblemen as haue heertofore borne the honorable tytles &amp; dignities of the Earldome of Cambridge, performed by Iohn Speede and are to be solde in popes head alley by John Sudbury and G. Humbell. It was published by J. Sudbury and G. Humbell in 1610. Scale [ca. 1:109,890]. Covers Cambridgeshire and portions of surrounding counties. 

The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the British National Grid coordinate system (British National Grid, Airy Spheroid OSGB (1936) Datum). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. 

This map shows features such as roads, cities and towns, drainage, and more. Relief is shown pictorially. Includes inset of Cambridge with index identifying colleges, churches and other places of interest.

This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project.  Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods.  These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.</abstract>
      <purpose>Historic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred in the cultural and physical landscape.  The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change.  As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>The georeferenced raster is a faithfully reproduced digital image of the original source map. Some differences may be detected between the source graphic used and the raster image due to the RGB values assigned that particular color. The intent is to recreate those colors as near as possible.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <complete>Data completeness for raster digital image files reflect content of the source graphic. Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic due to scale and legibility constraints</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The horizontal positional accuracy of a raster image is approximately the same as the accuracy of the published source map.  The lack of a greater accuracy is largely the result of the inaccuracies with the original measurements and possible distortions in the original paper map document. There may also be errors introduced during the digitizing and georeferencing process.  For instance, this raster image was georeferenced to another georeferenced image, which may have its own positional inaccuracies (see 'Process Steps').  In most cases, however, errors in the raster image are small compared with sources of error in the original map graphic.  The RMS error for this map is 2336.91107 meters.  This value describes how consistent the transformation is between the different control points (links).  The RMS error is only an assessment of the accuracy of the transformation.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>Production of this raster image began with the scanning of the paper map on a high-resolution scanner: (Betterlight, Super8K2 scanning back camera and ViewFinder 5.x capture software).  Maps were photographed at a copy stand. A vacuum easel was used to keep the maps flat during photography. The imaging specification was designed to produce detailed "Archival Master" images that, to the extent possible, are faithful reproductions of the originals, and that allow for highly detailed screen reproduction and print reproduction at up 1:1. Images in this collection were processed using Adobe Photoshop.  Color and tonal corrections were made using Adobe Photoshop. Image files were viewed on a calibrated monitor. Editing was performed in an ISO 3664 compliant proofing environment. Master Image files were corrected and archived as TIFF files in the sRGB IEC611966-2.1 color-space. When possible files were batch processed using an "action" script derived from edits applied to match a representative sample.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Using ArcMap 9.2 software, the digital TIFF image was georeferenced to common points located on digital vector shapefiles.  For this image, the following vector shapefiles was used as a base map for reference:  ESRI Data and Maps (2006) : Europe Water Bodies (1:100,000) and ESRI Data and Maps (2006) : Europe Places (1:100,000). The vector data was projected to the national grid coordinate system (British National Grid, Airy Spheroid OSGB (1936) Datum) and the images were subsequently georeferenced to the same projection. ArcMap 9.2 software was utilized for the georeferencing process, and a .tfwx (world file) and an .aux.xml file were automatically generated and saved in association with the digital image.  See 'Horizontal Accuracy' for the RMS error of this TIFF image.

Please note that while the image is stored in British National Grid coordinates, the projection will need to be defined by the user in order to display the image with other projected data, and the world file will need to be stored in the same root directory as the image.</procdesc>

    <overview>
      <eaover>The indexes reference a color palette of RGB values from 0 through 255, representing the color value from the original paper sheet map. The colors on that sheet can represent relief, drainage, vegetation, populated places, cultural features, coastal hydrography, transportation features (roads, railroads, tracks and trails), spot elevations and boundaries. The colors are sometimes explained in a legend that is incorporated into the map inset or collar.</eaover>
