      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by Esri: Extracted the data set from the subset of DeLorme World Base Map (DWBM). Deleted fields not needed. Dissolved features on all fields to reduce the number of features. Removed the ISO information from the source field NAME and put it in the new field ISO_CODE. Cleaned up the values in the field NAME. Corrected the values in the field ISO_CODE using the BS ISO 3166-2:2007 source. Copied the corrected values into the source fields ISO_CC and ISO_SUB. Removed any second-level administrative divisions. Corrected overlapping administrative divisions by using the GP tools Erase and Merge. Manually edited sliver, overlap, and void problems in the geometry between features. Removed the administrative type descriptions from the source field NOTES and put it in the new field ADMINTYPE. Augmented the values in the field ADMINTYPE using The World Factbook Online source. Reviewed disputed areas and then adjusted values in fields DISPUTED and NOTES; in the most sensitive areas, all country-based information was removed. Added new field COUNTRY and coded it based on the DeLorme World Base Map 2010 (Country_Boundaries) source. Added new field CONTINENT and coded it based on the Esri Data &amp; Maps 10 source. Added new fields LAND_TYPE and LAND_RANK to help differentiate features by size. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
