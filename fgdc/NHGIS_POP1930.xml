      <abstract>This boundary file contains historic county boundaries for which the U.S. Census Bureau tabulated data and was produced by the Minnesota Population Center as part of the National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS) project. The NHGIS county boundaries shapefile was joined with NHGIS total population tabular data from the same year by the Harvard University Center for Geographic Analysis. The county boundary shapefiles and its respective population data were joined for each decade, 1790-2000.The NHGIS is an National Science Foundation-sponsored project (Grant No. BCS0094908) to create a digital spatial-temporal database of all available historical US aggregate census materials.  The available shapefiles on the NHGIS site represent version 1.0 of historical US county boundary files for the 1790 to 2000 censuses. These electronic county boundary files were created by referencing a wide variety of sources and considerable care was taken during their production. U.S. Census Bureau TIGER/Line Census 2000 files provided the 1990 and 2000 county boundaries and the roads, hydrography, and public land survey lines required to construct historic county boundaries.  Locations of historic county boundaries were derived from William Thorndale and William Dollarhide's Map Guide to the U.S. Federal Censuses (1987), various volumes of John H. Long's Atlas of Historical County Boundaries, the Atlas of Historical County Boundaries website (http://www.newberry.org/ahcbp/), and other state-specific sources.  TIGER/Line spatial features that corresponded to boundaries in these sources were used to construct the proper historic boundaries.   When a TIGER/Line feature was not available, we digitized the historic boundary from one of the map sources.  Aggregate data from Michael Haines' Historical Demographic, Economic and Social Data: The United States, 1790-1970 (2001) and Richard Forstall's Population of States and Counties of the United States: 1790 to 1990 (1996) were used to determine whether a county was enumerated during a given census. If a county was not enumerated, notes from those sources were used to attach the county in question to the county with which it was enumerated. If a county was not enumerated and the notes provide no details, the county was considered 'unattached' and it was merged with other unattached land within the state or territory.</abstract>
      <purpose>These data are based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. BCS0094908 - in infrastructure grant provided for the social sciences. Its purpose is twofold. First, the NHGIS created and freely distributes a database incorporating all available aggregate census information for the United States between 1790 and 2000. The database contains information for a wide variety of statistical (blocks, block groups, census tracts, metropolitan statistical areas) and administrative units (places, minor civil divisions, counties, states).  Second, the NHGIS produced and freely distributes boundary files for small areas (census tracts and counties) in the United States. Boundary files for tracts are available for the 1910-2000 censuses, and boundary files for counties are available for the 1790-2000 censuses. The boundaries contained in this file do not necessarily represent legal county boundaries. Instead, they represent the county boundaries over which the U.S. Census Bureau tabulated and published data.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Counties are the primary legal subdivisions of most states and territories. Louisiana uses the term parish when referring to counties.  Alaska has no counties; instead, the equivalents to counties are census areas, boroughs, city and boroughs, and municipalities.  The U.S. Census Bureau and the state of Alaska jointly delineate the state's county equivalents.  The District of Columbia has to legal subdivisions; thus, the Census Bureau treats the entire entity as a county.  Four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia) have independent cities.  These cities are independent of any county and thus serve as county equivalents in their respective states.    The NHGIS assigned a four-digit code to every county and county equivalent within a state or territory.  The codes are assigned in alphabetical order, except for independent cities, which are assigned codes higher than counties. FIPS codes were used to uniquely identify a county within a state or territory, except for historical counties that were never assigned FIPS codes. For those historical counties, the NHGIS assigned a new code based on the alphabetical order of all counties a state or territory ever contained.</supplinf>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>All county codes were checked against codes in the available aggregate data to ensure accuracy and consistency. The boundary file may contain more or fewer counties than the aggregate data file. Sources for the boundary files sometimes depicted counties that contained no population; thus, they have no record in the aggregate data file.  Sometimes, the aggregate data files contain records for county equivalents that are not mappable (e.g., military forts).  Also, the boundary file sometimes contains an "unattached" county. This section of the state was not counted by the U.S. Census Bureau, but it has been included in order to depict the correct state/territory outline.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>All spatial data have been reviewed to assure topological consistency and completeness. All polygons close and do not overlap. No voids exist within polygons. ArcGIS topology features classes were used to identify and fix topological errors (e.g., overlaps, voids, missing polygons) in the county boundary datasets. The ArcGIS topology rules used to ensure logical consistency were 'Must not overlap' and 'Must be covered by'.</logic>
    <complete>Version 1.0 of the county boundary files contains counties and county equivalents.  Most counties, although not all, have a matching record in the aggregate data files.  Counties without a matching record were denoted on source materials as having "no population".  We still made those counties because we had a geographic representation of it.  Additionally, some records in the aggregate data files could not be mapped because they represent point features (e.g., military forts) - NHGIS boundary files are only composed of polygon features. Version 1.0 boundary files have not been generalized, and counties containing parts of the following bodies of water do not have historically accurate coastlines: the Great Lakes, Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and the Gulf of Mexico.  No counties overlap, no voids exist within counties, and any polygon belongs to one and only one county. Every county has a FIPS-like code (GISJOIN) that uniquely identifies it.  The aggregate data contains a matching code (GISJOIN) so that the files can be easily joined together.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The horizontal positional accuracy of the source data (U.S. Census Bureau TIGER/Line 2000 files) can be found at  http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tlmetadata/tl2kmeta.txt. To create historic county boundaries, we used existing TIGER lines whereever possible. When no TIGER line existed, we digitized new linework from scanned and rectified Thorndale and Dollarhide (1987) maps for John H. Long (various) maps. These historic county boundaries do not represent legal boundaries and should only be used for thematic mapping and statistical analysis.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>These process steps describe, in general, the procedures used to construct the NHGIS' historical county boundaries. The production procedures vary depending on the available source materials. The base counties were derived from the U.S. Census Bureau's Census 2000 TIGER/Line files. Many historical boundaries were derived from linear features also available in the TIGER/Line files. Those boundaries not available in digital form were digitized from scanned, geo-referenced maps.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The county polygon features classes were edited in ArcMap to create the historical county boundaries. Edits were based on the sources available for a given state.  Long (various) and Thorndale and Dollarhide (1987) were the main sources for historical boundaries.  Books depicting or describing historical county boundaries existed for some states, and these were used when available. First, the counties, water, and roads were loaded into ArcMap. Second, map topology was created for the county polygon feature class. Third, the roads or water features representing a historical boundary were selected. Fourth, the polygon or polygons that required editing were selected. Finally, the Construct Features option of the ArcMap topology toolbar was used to split the selected polygon(s) with the selected roads and/or water.  If a historical county boundary followed a feature not in the roads or water feature classes, the feature was digitized into the proper feature class.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Using historical census data acquired from Michael Haines, a database table was created for every state and territory in Microsoft Excel. The table contained a COUNTYSHAPE_ID for every census in which a county had data tabulated for it. The COUNTYSHAPE_ID was a concatenation of the county FIPS code and the census decade. The database table was saved as a comma-delimited file and imported into the ArcSDE database using a custom VBA script.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>After finishing the many-to-many relationships for the COUNTYSHAPE_IDs for a state or territory, a custom Python script was run to generate the counties for every census. Topology rules were established to detect holes and overlaps in a census' counties. The topology feature class was used to locate holes and overlaps. Custom ArcMap VBA tools were used to fix the "associations" between a county and the polygons comprising the county.  Individual polygons were deleted or added to an "association" in order to fix the topology error.  This step was repeated until all the topology errors in a state were eliminated.</procdesc>
