      <abstract>This datalayer is a polygon coverage for Massachusetts towns which will display town boundaries and high school dropout rates for each town for the year 1993.

This layer was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database published by the Harvard Map Collection in 2001. For more information on the definitions, data sources and process steps please read the "Supplemental Information" and "Data Quality" sections which follow.
The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library.</abstract>
      <purpose>This layer is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political anaylsis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.</purpose>
      <supplinf>These data were generated from the Massachusetts State Policy Data Base which is collected and maintained at the Massachusetts Institute for Social and Economic Research (MISER) at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. This specific dataset was created by MISER from data distributed by the Massachusetts Department of Education and rates were adjusted by MISER.

The Massachusetts Institute for Social and Economic Research (MISER) was founded in 1981 by the University of Massachusetts. MISER is an interdisciplinary research institute of the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences. It provides a variety of services to the University, the Commonwealth, and to national and international audiences. Faculty, students, and staff at MISER come from several academic areas, including the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, the School of Education, the College of Food and Natural Resources, the School of Management, and the School of Public Health.

MISER's research involves planning, strategy, and forecasting, with a focus on social, economic, and demographic issues. This work is designed to formulate new public policy for use by government policy makers, as well as to develop information systems showing the relationship between public policy and the economy of Massachusetts and New England. MISER contracts with a variety of clients to perform customized, large-scale research projects and analyses.</supplinf>

    <datacred>The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas dataset was a joint project of Douglas Carnahan, formerly of the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC), Richard Gelpke of the Earth and Geographic Sciences Department of the University of Massachusetts at Boston, and David Cobb, Bonnie Burns, Martin von Wyss, and Arlene Olivero of the Harvard Map Collection.  Valuable technical assistance and support has been provided by Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), Peter Girard of ESRI, and the Harvard College Library.</datacred>

        <horizpar>The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas' (MEA) mission to profile the Commonwealth's people and institutions did not require the highest level of positional accuracy.  Coordinates in these files are in decimal degrees and have six implied decimal places.  The six-decimal place precision is useful when producing maps as it allows you to place features that are next to each other on the ground in the correct position, relative to each other, on the map without overlap.</horizpar>
