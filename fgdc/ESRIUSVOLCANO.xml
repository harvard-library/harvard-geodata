        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was calculated from latitude/longitude coordinates. The positional accuracy is unknown.  Note that some locations are the center point of broad volcanic fields, and that even at individual volcanoes the coordinates given do not necessarily match the eruption site. Tens of kilometers may separate eruptive centers of a single volcano, particularly in large caldera complexes and rift settings.</horizpar>
