        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was extracted from the 2000 Census TIGER/Line files (CD-ROM edition).  The positional accuracy of the TIGER/Line coordinates varies with the source materials used but at best meets the established National Map Accuracy standards (+/- 167 feet approximately) where 1:100,000-scale maps from the USGS are the source. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of feature updates added by its field staff or of features derived from the GBF/DIME-Files or other map sources. Thus, the level of positional accuracy in the TIGER/Line files is not suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted geography from GDT Dynamap/2000 v14.0 provided by ESRI Business Information Solutions. Made shapes multi-part. Mated the geography with the 2003 U.S. Counties attributes. Merged county (FIPS: 51560) Clifton Forge, VA into (FIPS: 51005) Alleghany, and updated attribute values for (FIPS: 51005) by combining the two. Added county (FIPS: 08014) Broomfield, CO and adjusted surrounding counties (FIPS: 08001) Adams, (FIPS: 08013) Boulder, (FIPS: 08059) Jefferson, and (FIPS: 08123) Weld. Updated attribute values for all five counties (values provided by ESRI Business Information Solutions). Used null value -99 in the few places where no new values were provided and we did not have the information. Replaced POP2001 with POP2003 from ESRI Business Information Solutions. Changed attribute name AREA to SQMI. Converted the data set to SDC. Created the projection file (.prj) and spatial indices.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>This layer was originally downloaded from the ESRI Data and Maps 2004 DVD.  The file was stored in an SDC (Smart Data Compression) format on the DVD.  ArcCatalog 9.1 was utilized to export the SDC file to a shapefile, and then the "Repair Geometry" tool was used to correct geometric discrepancies that would otherwise have prevented a given line or polygon from being imported to Arc SDE.  After the "Repair Geometry" tool was run, the file was exported from ArcCatalog 9.1 to an ArcSDE 9.1 database, using the "Feature Class to Feature Class" export tool.</procdesc>
