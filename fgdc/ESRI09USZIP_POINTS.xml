      <abstract>U.S. ZIP Code Points represents the five-digit U.S. ZIP Code areas as points by placing their location using delivery-based centroids, plus all ZIP Codes that have no area and are represented as points rather than areas such as Post-Office-Box ZIP Codes and unique ZIP Codes (single site, building, or organization).</abstract>
      <purpose>U.S. ZIP Code Points provides the post office name, types, and area for each ZIP Code location in the United States.</purpose>

        <procdesc>Delivery-Based Centroids
Often, the distribution of postal deliveries is not evenly spread across a 5-digit ZIP code area, but is concentrated in one corner of the polygon. Delivery-based centroids were developed to express the actual distribution of deliveries within a ZIP code polygon. Delivery-based centroids may be thought of as "delivery"-weighted centroids. When delivery information is unavailable for a particular ZIP code polygon, the Tele Atlas Delivery-based centroid will show the geographic centroid.

Point ZIP Codes
There are many 5-digit ZIP Codes that have no area and are represented as points rather than polygons. These ZIP Codes appear as dots on a map with no area and, therefore, no boundaries. These ZIP Codes have no geographic extent defined in terms of street segments, or that corresponds to geography not defined in any Postal Service data files. Examples of point ZIP Codes include Post-Office-Box ZIP Codes, RPOs, and unique ZIP Codes (single site, building, or organization).</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted data set from Tele Atlas Dynamap ZIP Code Boundary &amp; Inventory Files v. 17.1. Removed unnecessary attributes and reformatted the rest. Added attributes POP2009, POP09_SQMI, and SQMI by joining to 2009 U.S. ZIP Code Areas (Five-Digit) and calculated their values to "-99" where there were no matches. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
