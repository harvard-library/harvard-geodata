  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: An improved map of the villages, roads, farm houses, &c. five miles round the city of Bath : from an actual survey, made by Tho. Thorpe & others ; Ashby sculpt., Russell Court Covent Garden, London. It was published for Pratt & Marshall, Booksellers in Milsom Street. Scale [ca. 1:42,200]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the 'British National Grid' coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, drainage, selected public buildings, churches, farms, industry locations (e.g. mills, factories, mines, etc.), landcover, and more. Paper backing (verso) also shows several floor plans and facade views of houses in Ketten Strasse. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
