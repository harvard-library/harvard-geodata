  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: A topographical map of the state of Rhode Island and Providence plantations, surveyed trigonometrically and in detail by James Stevens, topographer and civil engineer, Newport, R.I. 1831. It was published by James Stevens in 1832. Scale [ca. 1: 95,040]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Rhode Island NAD 1983 coordinate system (in Feet) (Fipszone 3800). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, drainage, public buildings, schools, hotels, banks, industry locations (e.g. mills, factories, mines, etc.), selected private buildings with names of property owners, town and county boundaries, canals, and more. Relief shown by hachures. Depths shown by soundings. Includes Census statistics and 'Remarks'.This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
