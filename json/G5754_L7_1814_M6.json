  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: London in miniature : with the surrounding villages, an entire new plan in which the improvements both present and intended are actually reduced (by permission) from the surveys of the several proprietors : the whole laide down from the best authorities, carefully corrected to the present time by Edward Mogg. It was published by Edward Mogg in 1814. Scale [ca. 1:16,000]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the British National Grid coordinate system (British National Grid, Airy Spheroid OSGB (1936) Datum). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, drainage, selected buildings, built-up areas, parks, borough boundaries, docks, bridges, and more. Relief is shown by hachures. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
