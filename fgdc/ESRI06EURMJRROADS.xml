The layer was stored in an SDC (Smart Data Compression) format on the DVD and exported to a shapefile format using the Feature Class to Feature Class tool in ArcCatalog 9.2.  The "Repair Geometry" tool was utilized to fix the geometry of the shapefile.  The shapefile was then exported to an ArcSDE 9.1 database using the"Feature Class to Feature Class" export tool.</procdesc>
