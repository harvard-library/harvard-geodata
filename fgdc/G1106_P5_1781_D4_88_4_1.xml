      <abstract>This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the untitled, historic nautical chart: [Buzzards Bay and Vineyard Sound] (sheet originally published in 1776).  The map is [sheet 7] from the Atlantic Neptune atlas Vol. 3 : Charts of the coast and harbors of New England, from surveys taken by Samuel Holland and published by J.F.W. Des Barres, 1781. Scale [ca. 1:52,000]. This layer is image 1 of 2 total images of the two sheet source map, representing the northern portion of the map. Covers a portion of Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts.

The image is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the 'World Mercator' (WGS 84) projected coordinate system. All map collar information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map.

This map shows coastal features such as harbors, inlets, rocks, channels, points, coves, shoals, islands, and more.  Includes also selected land features such as cities and towns. Relief is shown by hachures; depths by soundings and shading. 

This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection.  The entire Atlantic Neptune atlas Vol. 3 : Charts of the coast and harbors of New England has been scanned and georeferenced as part of this selection.</abstract>
      <purpose>Historic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred in the cultural and physical landscape.  The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change.  As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>The georeferenced raster is a faithfully reproduced digital image of the original source map. Some differences may be detected between the source graphic used and the raster image due to the RGB values assigned that particular color. The intent is to recreate those colors as near as possible.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <complete>Data completeness for raster digital image files reflect content of the source graphic. Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic due to scale and legibility constraints</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The horizontal positional accuracy of a raster image is approximately the same as the accuracy of the published source map.  The lack of a greater accuracy is largely the result of the inaccuracies with the original measurements and possible distortions in the original paper map document. There may also be errors introduced during the digitizing and georeferencing process.  In most cases, however, errors in the raster image are small compared with sources of error in the original map graphic.  The RMS error for this map is 397.00365 meters.  This value describes how consistent the transformation is between the different control points (links).  The RMS error is only an assessment of the accuracy of the transformation.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>Production of this raster image began with the scanning of the paper map on a high-resolution scanner: (Betterlight, Super8K2 scanning back camera and ViewFinder capture software). 

Digital images of from the Harvard Map Collection were created by Harvard College Library Imaging Services in 2008. Maps were photographed at a copy stand. The imaging specification was designed to produce detailed "Archival Master" images that, to the extent possible, are faithful reproductions of the originals, and that allow for highly detailed screen reproduction and print reproduction at up 1:1. Images in this collection were processed in Adobe Photoshop. Subjective color and contrasting editing was performed at the discretion of the photographer. Color and tonal corrections were made using Adobe Photoshop. Image files were viewed on a calibrated monitor. Editing was performed in an ISO 3664 compliant proofing environment. Master Image files were corrected and archived as TIFF files in the Adobe RGB (1988) or sRGB IEC611966-2.1 color-spaces, at the photographer's discretion. The imaging specification for the "delivery" JPEG2000 images was designed to produce images optimized for variable size viewing on the Web. These delivery images were derived in batches from sharpened versions of the "archival master" files, and converted and tagged with the sRGB IEC611966-2.1 colorspace profile (ICC). The colorspace tag is used to assure that color and tonal information is properly displayed across multiple systems and media.

Image resolution is of sufficient quality to render all meaningful map details on screen and in print; Format is 24 bit TIFF, uncompressed; Tone/color reproduction: embedded ICC (International Color Consortium) profile with associated size and tone reference. Quality control: visual inspection, MD5 checksum for 100% of images.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Using ArcMap 9.2 software, the digital TIFF image was georeferenced to common points located on digital vector shapefiles.  For this image, the following vector shapefiles were used for reference and linking:  NOAA Medium Resolution Digital Vector Shoreline (1:70,000) (data released in 1994). The vector data was projected to the 'World Mercator' projected coordinate system, and the images were subsequently georeferenced to the same projection.  A world file (.tfwx) and an '.aux.xml' file were automatically generated and saved in association with the digital TIFF image.  See 'Horizontal Accuracy' for the RMS error of this TIFF image. 

Please note that while the image is stored in 'World Mercator' coordinates, the projection will need to be defined by the user in order to display the image with other projected data and the world file will need to be stored in the same root directory as the image.</procdesc>
