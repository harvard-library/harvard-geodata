        <procdesc>This file was originally digitized by the National Mapping Division based on the sectional maps contained in 'The National Atlas of the United States of America' published by the USGS in 1970.  The 1:2,000,000-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) data were merged into a single national hydrography coverage. Where necessary to effect the merge, alignment changes were made.  The names were taken from the USGS Topographic 1:100,000-scale maps.  For Alaska, the names were taken from the USGS Topographic 1:250,000-scale maps.  State lines across water bodies were removed from the national coverage.  State attributes were assigned to the features.

Some spatial features were added and corrected.  Some name attributes were added or corrected.  All occurrences of St. were changed to Saint.  Extra spaces were removed from the attributes.  Hydrographic features for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were added. A minor adjustment was made to the shoreline in Galveston Bay, Texas. The linear water feature attribute value, Intercoastal waterway, was changed to Intracoastal waterway.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded the compressed file from http://www.nationalatlas.gov/atlasftp.html and extracted it. Removed unneeded attributes. Removed all records except those with FEATURE attribute types of "Aqueduct", "Braided Stream", "Canal", "Canal Intermittent", "Dam", "Falls", "Intracoastal Waterway", "Stream", and "Stream Intermittent". Reduced the attribute widths of FEATURE and NAME. Added attribute MILES and calculated its values. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
