      <abstract>This datalayer displays a point coverage representing telecommunications businesses throughout Massachusetts. Business types contained here include:
Communications Equipment (SIC Code 366)
Establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing wire telephone and telegraph equipment, radio and television broadcasting and communications equipment, and other miscellaneous types of communications equipment.

Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical (SIC Code 381):
Establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing search, detection, navigation, guidance, aeronautical, and nautical systems and instruments. Important products of this industry are radar systems and equipment; sonar systems and equipment; navigation systems and equipment; countermeasures equipment; aircraft and missile control systems and equipment; flight and navigation sensors, transmitters, and displays.

Telephone Communications (SIC Code 481):
Establishments primarily engaged in providing two-way radiotelephone communications services, such as cellular telephone services.

Cable and Other Pay Television Services (SIC Code 484):
Establishments primarily engaged in the dissemination of visual and textual television programs, on a subscription or fee basis.

Communications Services, Not Elsewhere Classified (SIC Code 489):
Establishments primarily engaged in furnishing communications services, not elsewhere classified such as: Radar station operation; Satellite earth stations; Satellite or missile tracking stations, etc.

Internet, personal communications services and cellular use is proliferating, while older methods of accessing information, such as the telephone and cable TV, are blending with the new. Statewide employment in the telecommunications industry grew by an astounding 71 percent between 1993 and 1997. Rapid increase in telecommunications equipment and services spending will likely lead to further economic growth, especially for the Boston region

This dataset was originally prepared by the Center for Labor Market Studies, Northeastern University and distributed by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council in 1996. It was published as part of the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database in 2001. 

The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library.

The Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) is a regional planning agency representing 101 cities and towns in the metropolitan Boston area.  Created by an act of the Legislature in 1963, it serves as a forum for state and local officials to address issues of regional importance. As one of 14 members of the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), MAPC has oversight responsibility for the region's federally funded transportation program
Stretching west from Boston to include most of the communities inside the I-495 corridor, the MAPC planning area consists of 22 cities and 79 towns. Coastal communities, older industrial centers, rural towns, and modern cities are represented within the 1,422 square miles that comprise the MAPC region.</abstract>
      <purpose>This layer is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political anaylsis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.</purpose>

    <datacred>The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas dataset was a joint project of Douglas Carnahan, formerly of the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC), Richard Gelpke of the Earth and Geographic Sciences Department of the University of Massachusetts at Boston, and David Cobb, Bonnie Burns, Martin von Wyss, and Arlene Olivero of the Harvard Map Collection.  Valuable technical assistance and support has been provided by Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), Peter Girard of ESRI, and the Harvard College Library.</datacred>

The attribute accuracy of these files is as precise as the source used during the creation or update of the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) database. Accuracy statements on the MEA database are based on deductive estimates; no specific field tests for attribute accuracy have been conducted on the files.</attraccr>

      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas' (MEA) mission to profile the Commonwealth's people and institutions did not require very high levels of positional accuracy in its geographic products. Its files and maps are designed to show only the relative positions of elements. Coordinates in these files are in decimal degrees and have six implied decimal places. The Harvard Geospatial Library cannot specify the accuracy of feature updates or of features derived from the MEA files or other map or digital sources. Thus, the level of positional accuracy in these MEA layers is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface. The six-decimal place precision is useful when producing maps. This precision allows you to place features that are next to each other on the ground in the correct position, relative to each other, on the map without overlap.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>Tabular data compiled and edited from Massachusetts Department of Employment and Job Training Guide by the Center for Labor Market Studies, Northeastern University, January 1996; Town boundary data derived from MassGIS database. Geographic data was obtained by the Harvard Map Collection via CD-ROM. Attribute information was downloaded from Internet as Excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheet was converted to a DBF file, which was joined to the geography using ArcView GIS v 3.2. The join was based on the town name.</procdesc>
