        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Changed the NAME attribute values to title case. Added TYPE attribute. Stripped out the generic terminal information from the NAME attribute and put it in TYPE. For example, 'Dallas Bus Station' became NAME of 'Dallas' with a TYPE of 'Bus Station'. Removed multiple Marine Terminal points. Multiple points represented most marine terminal locations, one for each of the ferries route destination locations. The multiple points were deleted, leaving only one point to represent the actual terminal.</procdesc>
