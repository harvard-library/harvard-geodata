Dataset was derived from 6 sheet maps from a series of Soviet Army topographic maps of China 1:200,000, prepared and printed by the Soviet Army General Headquarters, 1976-1991. Source maps were scanned and georeferenced to the Gauss-Kruger projection by Harvard Map Collection staff. Roads were traced and points were placed in ArcMap from the GeoTIFF using heads-up digitizing by East View Cartographic, Inc.",
