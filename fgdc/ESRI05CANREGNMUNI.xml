        <procdesc>The data set is a fully georeferenced, purely digital product. The boundaries are digitized from CanMap. The Regional Municipalities layer is comprised of intermediate political administrative areas between the Province/Territories and Municipalities. DMTI Spatial Regional Municipalities correspond to Statistics Canada 2001 Census Divisions (CD). Source data ranges from municipal mapping at a very large scale of 1:2,000 or larger, to a medium scale of 1:50,000 scale from NTDB*.  Source time period of content ranges from a few to several years (as in the case of NTDB*).
 
*NTDB is the National Topographic Data Base, developed and maintained by Natural Resources Canada.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted data set from DMTI Spatial Canadian Data Bundle. Clipped the features to the coastline and adjusted attributes. Added attribute SQKM and calculated its values. Added attribute COLORMAP and calculated its values from 1 to 6. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
