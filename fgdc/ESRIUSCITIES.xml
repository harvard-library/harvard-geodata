        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Created a data set by extracting places of 10,000 or more inhabitants from U.S. Bureau of the Census 1990 Summary Tape File 1C (STF-1C).  Ran ArcView command Add Event Theme on the data set to create the point location centroids shapefile. Converted to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) by splitting the United States into Alaska, Hawaii, and the 48 contiguous states (including District of Columbia); converting each to NAD83; then merging them together.  Created ArcGIS(tm) layer file (.lyr).  Created ArcView legend file (.avl).  Created projection file (.prj).  Ran ArcView Avenue request ExportClean, and created spatial indices.</procdesc>
