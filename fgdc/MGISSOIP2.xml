      <abstract>This datalayer contains polygons representing soil survey areas for a portion of the state of Massachusetts (see also Soils (Arcs)).  The soils datalayer has been automated from 1:25,000 published soils surveys as provided on various media by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). All soils data released by MassGIS have been "SSURGO-certified ," which means they have been reviewed and approved by the NRCS and meet all standards and requirements for inclusion in the national release of county-level digital soils data. Soil survey areas are roughly based on county boundaries.</abstract>
      <purpose>The data set was developed for display and analysis using GIS.

This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool in permitting or siting decisions, but may be used as a reference source. This information may be interpreted by organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on needs; however they are responsible for the appropriate application. Federal, state, or local regulatory bodies are not to assign to the NRCS any authority for the decisions that they will make. The NRCS will not perform any evaluations of these maps for purposes related solely to state or local regulatory programs.</purpose>
      <supplinf>This datalayer is maintained by DFA. Additional survey areas will be added as they become available</supplinf>

    <useconst>Maps that use NRCS SSURGO data must show the source (NRCS) and date and, space permitting, contain the following notation:  

"This Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) data base was produced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service and cooperating agencies for the Soil Survey of _______ County, (state). The soils were mapped at a scale of ______ with a _______ acre minimum size delineation. Enlargement of these maps to scales greater than that at which they were originally mapped can cause misunderstanding of the detail of mapping. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of contrasting soil that could have been shown at a larger scale. The depicted soil boundaries and interpretations derived from them do not eliminate the need of onsite sampling, testing, and detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, this map and its interpretations are intended for planning purposes only. Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data."

        <procdesc>Source materials vary by survey area and include scribecoat, clear film positives, and half-tone mylars containing soil lines as well as labels and cultural features. Source sheets to date contained data by "third-quad," a standard NRCS tiling scheme for its published surveys which splits a USGS quadrangle into three sections (north, central and south). Each survey done to date has been based on 1:25,000 orthophoto base maps. Source mylars were scanned at a resolution of 500 dots per inch. The scanned images were registered, rectified, and converted to grids using ARC/INFO. Soils linework was extracted from the grids in the ARC/INFO GRID module and vectorized. MassGIS completed all processing from scanning through vectorization.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Map neatline development, line smoothing, labeling, edge matching, and merging of third-quads into full 7.5 minute quads was done by Massachusetts Department of Food and Agriculture staff. Special and ad hoc features such as rock outcrops or stripped land areas that are smaller than the original NRCS minimum mapping units were manually digitized by DFA. These features were captured due to their uniqueness in their surroundings and are represented as point and line data because they are too small to be shown as area features at the scale of mapping. They form a coverage (SPO) separate from the soil area delineation. Mass DFA staff performed all quality checking prior to submittal for SSURGO certification.</procdesc>

NRCS soil scientists edgematched each survey area to all abutting surveys (including those in adjacent states) and these edits were incorporated into the quad coverages. Mylar checkplots were provided to NRCS for compilation of special and ad hoc features that were digitized by DFA staff. Each quad within the survey area was submitted to the NRCS Missouri Digitizing Unit for SSURGO review and these edits were incorporated in the final datalayer.</procdesc>
