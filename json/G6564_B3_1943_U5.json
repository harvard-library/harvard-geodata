Scale 1:14,000. Covers Barcelona, Spain. Copied from a Spanish Map, 1:14,000, Plano de Barcelona; corrected from I.S.I.S.

All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, drainage, docks, selected buildings, points of military interest, city districts, and more. Includes inset: [Enlargement of old city section]. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
