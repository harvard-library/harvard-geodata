  "dc_description_s": "These polygons represent 9 provinces existing in the sovereign states of the German Confederation (the Deutscher Bund) in 1826, which were located within the (future) boundaries of the German Empire that would be founded in 1871 ('core Germany'). Since in 1826 only Prussia used provinces as administrative units, the provincial dataset as a layer likewise represents the territorial extension of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1820. Compared to 1820, the two most western located provinces of Juelich-Kleve-Berg and Niederrhein have merged to now represent the province of Rhineland (Rheinprovinz).",
