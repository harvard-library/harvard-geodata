    <logic>The shapefile is converted to SDC (Smart Data Compression) format using either ESRI SDC Data Development Kit Professional 2 (DDKP2) or tools in ArcGIS.  The SDC data set is then loaded into ArcSDE to verify and validate the geometry.</logic>
    <complete>After processing, the data set is checked for drawing display and number of records and file sizes compared with source materials.

Line simplification and smoothing was performed with a tolerance of 0.005 decimal degrees and a coordinate reduction using the Douglas-Peucker method with a tolerance of 0.0003 decimal degrees. Very small polygons were eliminated when the combination of geographic codes existed elsewhere.</complete>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Converted to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). Added features for Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico from the ESRI Data &amp; Maps 2002 U.S. 107th Congressional Districts. Corrected attribute value consistency problems. Replaced the entire outer boundary of the continental U.S. (coastlines and international) with features from the U.S. 107th Congressional Districts. Generalized to a tolerance of 0.0003 decimal degrees. Created region (multi-poly) features based on the four-digit state/district id. Then formatted the attributes to match the common attributes in the U.S. 107th Congressional Districts. The values for the attributes, NAME and PARTY, were completed from The Associated Press and National Committee for an Effective Congress. In two records, the winner was still undecided, and the NAME and PARTY attributes were coded with "TBD". Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC.</procdesc>

Updated the attribute values to represent the 109th Congress. Corrected the values for DISTRICTID attribute by changing 'xx99' to 'xx00'. Added the new value of 'Vacant' to the PARTY attribute. Recalculated the SQMI attribute values. Reduced the attribute width for NAME.</procdesc>

Removed Alaskan islands west of 180 degrees longitude.  Changed attribute SQMI to display only two decimal places.  Converted the data set to SDC.

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Copied the ESRI Data &amp; Maps 2006 U.S. 109th Congressional Districts (CD) and converted to shapefile. Downloaded 2006 TIGER/Line files for Pennsylvania from the U.S. Census Bureau website, extracted out block polygons, and converted to shapefile. Dissolved block polygons on the CD ID to create the updated Pennsylvania CD boundaries shapefile. Deleted old Pennsylvania features from the 109th CD shapefile and saved them into a separate shapefile. Extended all exterior boundaries of the updated Pennsylvania CD shapefile, and then clipped them back using the old Pennsylvania features to ensure coincidence with the adjacent state boundaries and with the coastline detail. Added and calculated attributes in the updated Pennsylvania shapefile, including new SQMI values, to match the 109th CD shapefile. Merged the updated Pennsylvania shapefile with the 109th CD shapefile. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
