      <abstract>U.S. Airports represents airport grounds and airport runways within the United States. All airports have a boundary, and most have at least one runway.</abstract>
      <purpose>U.S. Airports provides the boundaries for thousands of airports and runways. There are many attributes that describe each airport, for example, location id (airport code), owner, elevation, congestion level, large certified air carrier enplanements, foreign enplanements, hub size, and tower type.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Largest scale when displaying the data: 1:50,000.</supplinf>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted the Land Use data sets from Tele Atlas MultiNet North America v. 2010.03 and merged them into a nationwide data set. Selected the airport ground and runway features. Removed all fields except FEATTYP, NAME, and ACRON. Renamed field FEATTYP to MNFC. Renamed field ACRON to LOC_ID. Attached and formatted the fields from 2009 Data Update U.S. Airports (source dates - 1991, 1992, and 1994). Put a "-999" value into all records that did not find a match for the field ELEVATION. Put a "0" value into all records that did not find a match for the fields LRGCERTENP, COMM_ENP, AIRTAXIENP, FOREIGNENP and INTRANENP. Added field FEATTYPE and copied its values from MultiNet FEATTYP descriptions. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
