      <abstract>This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: New map of that portion of North America, exhibiting the United States and territories, the Canadas, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Mexico, also Central America, and the West India Islands : compiled from the most recent surveys and authentic sources. It was published by Jacob Monk in 1853. Scale [ca. 1:3,168,000]. This layer is image 2 of 4 total images, representing the northwest portion of the four sheet source map.The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the North America Lambert Conformal Conic projection. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, cities and other human settlements, stage roads, railroads, canals, territorial and administrative boundaries, shoreline features, and more. Relief shown by hachures and spot heights. Includes list of U.S. counties and county towns, table of distances, explanation legend, and inset map: New map of the World on Mercator[s] projection.This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of North America from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.</abstract>
      <purpose>Historic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred in the cultural and physical landscape.  The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change.  As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>The georeferenced raster is a faithfully reproduced digital image of the original source map. Some differences may be detected between the source graphic used and the raster image due to the RGB values assigned that particular color. The intent is to recreate those colors as near as possible.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <complete>Data completeness for raster digital image files reflect content of the source graphic. Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic due to scale and legibility constraints</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The horizontal positional accuracy of a raster image is approximately the same as the accuracy of the published source map.  The lack of a greater accuracy is largely the result of the inaccuracies with the original measurements and possible distortions in the original paper map document. There may also be errors introduced during the digitizing and georeferencing process.  In most cases, however, errors in the raster image are small compared with sources of error in the original map graphic.  The RMS error for this map is 29934.54039 meters.  This value describes how consistent the transformation is between the different control points (links).  The RMS error is only an assessment of the accuracy of the transformation.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>Production of this raster image began with the scanning of the paper map on a high-resolution scanner: (Betterlight, Super8K2 scanning back camera and ViewFinder 5.x capture software).  Maps were photographed at a copy stand. A vacuum easel was used to keep the maps flat during photography. The imaging specification was designed to produce detailed "Archival Master" images that, to the extent possible, are faithful reproductions of the originals, and that allow for highly detailed screen reproduction and print reproduction at up 1:1. Images were processed Adobe Photoshop. Color and tonal corrections were made using Adobe Photoshop. Image files were viewed on a calibrated monitor. Editing was performed in an ISO 3664 compliant proofing environment. Master Image files were corrected and archived as TIFF files in the sRGB IEC611966-2.1 color-space.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Using ArcMap 9.3 software, the digital TIFF image was georeferenced to common points located on digital vector shapefiles.  For this image, the following vector shapefiles were used as a base map for reference: ESRI Data and Maps 2008: "Mexico States" (1:400,000), "U.S. States" (1:100,000), and "U.S. Rivers (Generalized)" (1:5,000,000). The vector data was projected in the North America Lambert Conformal Conic projection, and the image was subsequently georeferenced to the same projection.A world file (.tfw) was automatically generated and saved in association with the digital image. See 'Horizontal Accuracy' for the RMS error of this image. Please note that the projection will need to be defined by the user in order to display the image with other projected data and the world file will need to be stored in the same root directory as the image.</procdesc>

    <overview>
      <eaover>The indexes reference a color palette of RGB values from 0 through 255, representing the color value from the original paper sheet map. The colors on that sheet can represent relief, drainage, vegetation, populated places, cultural features, coastal hydrography, transportation features (roads, railroads, tracks and trails), spot elevations and boundaries. The colors are sometimes explained in a legend that is incorporated into the map inset or collar.</eaover>
