  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer is a polygon coverage representing First-Order Administrative Areas worldwide (as they existed in 2002) and was originally produced by ESRI for the Global GIS database. Attribute data includes information on administrative region names, type, size (population) and country of location. The USGS Global GIS database contains a wealth of USGS and other public domain data, including global coverages of elevation, landcover, seismicity, and resources of minerals and energy at a nominal scale of 1:1 million. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and The American Geological Institute (AGI) announced a cooperative agreement that will focus on making the USGS Global Geographic Information System (GIS) database readily available to educators and the general public in the form of a DVD based world atlas.",
