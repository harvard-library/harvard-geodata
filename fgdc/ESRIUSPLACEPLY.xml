      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was extracted from the 1990 Census Version TIGER/Line(tm) files (CD-ROM edition).  The positional accuracy of the TIGER/Line coordinates varies with the source materials used but at best meets the established National Map Accuracy standards (+/- 167 feet approximately) where 1:100,000-scale maps from the USGS are the source. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of feature updates added by its field staff or of features derived from the GBF/DIME-Files or other map sources. Thus, the level of positional accuracy in the TIGER/Line files is not suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>The data included in these boundary files was extracted from the 1990 Census Version TIGER/Line files (CD-ROM edition). The County, Tract, Block Group, and Place files have been edited together. This means that where appropriate, they nest on top of one another. For example, a segment of a place boundary that happens to be along a county border will match exactly with the corresponding segment in the County Boundary File.</procdesc>

Recalculated any attributes based on area.  Merged all states into a national data set.  Removed unneeded attributes. Added attributes from ESRI Data &amp; Maps 1999 data set-places.shp. Added attributes from the U.S. Bureau of the Census 1990 Summary Tape File 1C (STF-1C). Created ArcGIS(tm) layer file (.lyr).  Created ArcView legend file (.avl).  Created projection file (.prj).  Ran ArcView Avenue request ExportClean, and created spatial indices.</procdesc>
