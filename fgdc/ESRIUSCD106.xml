    <logic>No duplicate features are present.  The shapefile is exported using Avenue request ExportClean.  This request verifies and enforces the correctness of shapes.</logic>

    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was extracted from the 1990 Census Version TIGER/Line(tm) files, then generalized to 1:5,000,000-scale.  Generalizing reduced the positional accuracy to (+/- 8350 feet approximately).  This is based on the  positional accuracy of the TIGER/Line coordinates before being generalized which varies with the source materials used but at best meets the established National Map Accuracy standards (+/- 167 feet approximately) where 1:100,000-scale maps from the USGS are the source. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of feature updates added by its field staff or of features derived from the GBF/DIME-Files or other map sources. Thus, the level of positional accuracy in the TIGER/Line files is not suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.</horizpar>

Converted to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) by splitting the United States into-if present: Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa-and the 48 contiguous states (including District of Columbia); converting each to NAD83 (American Samoa remains in NAD27 and Hawaiian islands west of 161 degrees West longitude remain in Old Hawaiian Datum); then merging them together.  Removed unneeded attributes.  Renamed attributes to match other, similar, ESRI Data &amp; Maps attribute names.  Dissolved on Name.  Created ArcGIS(tm) layer file (.lyr).  Created ArcView legend file (.avl).  Created projection file (.prj).  Ran ArcView Avenue request ExportClean, and created spatial indices.</procdesc>
