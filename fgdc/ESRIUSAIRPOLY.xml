      <abstract>U.S. GDT Airports represents airport boundaries and airport runways within United States. All airports have a boundary and most have at least one runway.</abstract>
      <purpose>U.S. GDT Airports provides the boundaries for thousands of airports and runways.  There are many attributes that describe each airport, for example, three or four character location id (airport code), owner, elevation, congestion level, large certified air carrier enplanements, foreign enplanements, hub size, and tower type.</purpose>
