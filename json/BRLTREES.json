  "dc_description_s": "The Street Trees layer is a point coverage inventory of each street tree in the Town of Brookline. Attributes described include species, diameter, condition, management need, growing conditions, predominant root zone cover, presence of utility or power lines, location (on the street or in a park), etc. The Brookline Street Tree Inventory was initially conducted in 1994 as a cooperative project of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, U.S. Forest Service, Massachusetts Department of Environmental Management, and the Town of Brookline; other supporting organizations include the Harvard University Arnold Arboretum and the Brookline Green Space Alliance. The Town agencies involved in the project include the Conservation Commission, Tree Planting Committee, and the Department of Public Works. This project, thought to be the first comprehensive municipal street tree inventory based on GIS, recruited and trained over 100 citizens to perform the inventory. Teams of volunteers were assigned areas of the town in which to locate each street tree on the Town's Assessor's Maps for digitizing at a later time by UMass/Amherst.",
