      <abstract>This datalayer is a polygon coverage which represents the number of deaths per town in Massachusetts in 1995 and a breakdown of the major causes of death. 

These statistics were originally compiled and published by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health: Division of Research and Epidemiology under the title, "Selected Causes of Death by Municipality in Massachusetts: 1995."

This layer was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database published by the Harvard Map Collection in 2001. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library.</abstract>
      <purpose>This layer is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political anaylsis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.</purpose>
      <supplinf>The Massachusetts Department of Public Health: Division of Research and Epidemiology provides health related information to the Department, other agencies, community groups, researchers, and the public. The focus of the Division is on providing health status, demographic, and disease risk factor information for program planning and policy development through publications, information dissemination, and access to computer databases.

The Center for Health Information, Statistics, Research and Evaluation monitors the health status of  Massachusetts residents through collecting information on births, deaths, newly diagnosed cases of cancer, occupational conditions and illnesses, and health behaviors. Health Statistics and Research provides information that is essential for identifying local and statewide problems, while targeting and evaluating public health programs.
Information is made available to the through publications, Community Health Network reports, the Massachusetts Community Health Information Profile (MassCHIP) electronic information service, and consulting and technical assistance.

    <datacred>The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas dataset was a joint project of Douglas Carnahan, formerly of the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC), Richard Gelpke of the Earth and Geographic Sciences Department of the University of Massachusetts at Boston, and David Cobb, Bonnie Burns, Martin von Wyss, and Arlene Olivero of the Harvard Map Collection.  Valuable technical assistance and support has been provided by Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), Peter Girard of ESRI, and the Harvard College Library.</datacred>

The attribute accuracy of these files is as precise as the source used during the creation or update of the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) database. Accuracy statements on the MEA database are based on deductive estimates; no specific field tests for attribute accuracy have been conducted on the files.

Age Adjusted Attribute Explanation:
Age-Adjusted Rate:
A summary rate designed to minimize the distortions created by differences in age distribution when comparing rates for populations with different age compositions. Age-adjusted rates are useful when comparing death rates from different populations or in the same population over time. For example, if one wished to compare the 1998 death rates between Barnstable County (Cape Cod) and Hampshire County, the age-adjusted formula would account for the fact that 24% of the Barnstable County residents were 65 years of age or older, whereas only 11% of the Hampshire County residents were in this age group. Age-adjusted rates are calculated by weighting the age-specific rates for a given year by the age distribution of a standard population. The weighted age-specific rates are then added to produce the adjusted rate for all ages combined. 

The 1940 US projected population was used by National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as the standard population for mortality statistics for this datalayer.  Beginning with 1999, a new standard population was implemented, The 2000 US projected population is the new standard population for age-adjustment of mortality rates. ONLY RATES USING THE SAME STANDARD POPULATION CAN BE COMPARED. The rates displayed here, based on the 1940 standard, should bot be compared to data based on the new standard.

Standard Population:
A standard population is a set of arbitrary population weights representing the age distribution of a defined population. The standard population weights are used to adjust the age-specific rate for each of the comparison populations of interest (for example, the same population over time, or different geographies or race/ethnicity populations). The resulting weighted age-specific rates are then summed to produce the total age-adjusted rate for the populations of interest.</attraccr>

    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas' (MEA) mission to profile the Commonwealth's people and institutions did not require very high levels of positional accuracy in its geographic products. Its files and maps are designed to show only the relative positions of elements. Coordinates in these files are in decimal degrees and have six implied decimal places.  
The Harvard Geospatial Library cannot specify the accuracy of feature updates or of features derived from the MEA files or other map or digital sources. Thus, the level of positional accuracy in these MEA layers is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface. The six-decimal place precision is useful when producing maps. This precision allows you to place features that are next to each other on the ground in the correct position, relative to each other, on the map without overlap.</horizpar>
