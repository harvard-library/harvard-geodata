It was published by P.G. Chanlaire and E. Mentelle ca. 1807. Scale ca. 1:3,500,000. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the North American Lambert Conformal Conic coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map.
