        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was extracted from the 2000 Census TIGER/Line files (CD-ROM edition).  The positional accuracy of the TIGER/Line coordinates varies with the source materials used but at best meets the established National Map Accuracy standards (+/- 167 feet approximately) where 1:100,000-scale maps from the USGS are the source. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of feature updates added by its field staff or of features derived from the GBF/DIME-Files or other map sources. Thus, the level of positional accuracy in the TIGER/Line files is not suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>How GDT Creates These Files: The data included in the boundary files was extracted from the 2000 Census TIGER/Line files. Once extracted, the County, Tract, and Block Group information was edited as one database, assuring that they have perfect overlay characteristics where appropriate. When all editing was complete, the different layers were separated into products.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted geography from GDT Dynamap 2000/Census v14.0 provided by ESRI Business Information Solutions. Made shapes multi-part. Removed Puerto Rico. Mated the geography with the 2003 U.S. Census Tracts attributes. Changed the FIPS code for Clifton Forge, VA to reflect county change. Updated attributes for counties (FIPS: 08014) Broomfield, CO, (FIPS: 08001) Adams, (FIPS: 08013) Boulder, (FIPS: 08059) Jefferson, and (FIPS: 08123) Weld to reflect changes with values provided by ESRI Business Information Solutions. Changed attribute name AREA to SQMI. Recalculated values for POP00_SQMI and SQMI. Replaced POP2001 with POP2003 from ESRI Business Information Solutions using null value -99 where no new values were provided for county changes. Converted the data set to SDC. Created the projection file (.prj) and spatial indices.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>This layer was originally downloaded from the ESRI Data and Maps 2004 DVD.  The file was stored in an SDC (Smart Data Compression) format on the DVD.  ArcCatalog 9.1 was utilized to export the SDC file to a shapefile, and then the "Repair Geometry" tool was used to correct geometric discrepancies that would otherwise have prevented a given line or polygon from being imported to Arc SDE.  After the "Repair Geometry" tool was run, the file was exported from ArcCatalog 9.1 to an ArcSDE 9.1 database, using the "Feature Class to Feature Class" export tool.</procdesc>

        <enttypd>The polygons represent U.S. Census tracts within United States. Tract - a small, relatively permanent statistical subdivision of a county or statistically equivalent entity, delineated for data presentation purposes by a local group of census data users or the geographic staff of a regional census center in accordance with Census Bureau guidelines. Designed to be relatively homogeneous units with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions at the time they are established, census tracts generally contain between 1,000 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being stable over many decades, so they generally follow relatively permanent visible features. However, they may follow governmental unit boundaries and other invisible features in some instances; the boundary of a state or county (or statistically equivalent entity) is always a census tract boundary.</enttypd>
