    <logic>The shapefile is converted to SDC (Smart Data Compression) format using tools in ArcGIS.  The SDC data set is then imported into a file geodatabase to verify, validate, and if needed repair the geometry.</logic>

        <horizpar>Horizontal positional accuracy is dependent on geographic area. In most areas, accuracy is between 5 and 25 meters (16 and 82 feet). In some areas, accuracy is off by up to several tens of meters (100 feet or more). In the poorest areas, accuracy is off by up to 100 meters (328 feet).</horizpar>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by Esri: Extracted the Points of Interest (POI) data set from TomTom MultiNet POI North America v. 2011.09. Selected features that intersected Data &amp; Maps 10 U.S. Counties to get the U.S. features only. Selected the recreation area features. Renamed MultiNet field FEATTYP to MNFC. Added field FCC and calculated its values based on MultiNet FEATTYP equivalents. Added field FEATTYPE and copied its values from MultiNet FEATTYP descriptions. Added field TEXTLENGTH and calculated its values to the length of the text in the NAME field. Added the STCTYFIPS field and coded it by overlaying on Data &amp; Maps 10 U.S. Counties. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>This layer was downloaded from the Esri Data and Maps 10.1 DVD.  The layer was originally stored in an SDC (Smart Data Compression) format.
