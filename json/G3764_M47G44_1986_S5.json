  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Zoning map of the town of Maynard, Massachusetts, prepared for the Maynard Planning Board, Sep-1969 ; compiled by Snelling, Hilton & Associates ; revised by Herrick & Murphy to Dec 1972. It was published by Dufresne-Henry Engineering Corp., ca. 1986. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, drainage, cities and other human settlements, territorial boundaries, shoreline features, and more. Includes also zoning districts, street legend, street names, landmark names, and US government test area (formerly Sudbury Training Annex of Fort Devens, now Assabet River National Wildlife Refuge). This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
