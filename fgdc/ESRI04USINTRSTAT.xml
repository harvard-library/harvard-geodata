      <abstract>U.S. National Transportation Atlas Interstate Highways represents rural and urban interstate highways. U.S. National Transportation Atlas Interstate Highways is part of the National Highway Planning Network version 4.0 (line) published by the Federal Highway Administration as part of the National Transportation Atlas Databases for the United States.</abstract>
      <purpose>U.S. National Transportation Atlas Interstate Highways provides a comprehensive database of interstate highways from the nation's principal arterial highway system and the National Highway System.  The data is generalized to improve draw performance and be used effectively at a national level.</purpose>

        <procdesc>The general processing steps for the creation of the National Highway Planning Network:
- [1993] Conflation of attributes for rural highways from [National Highway Planning Network V1.1, Bruce Peterson, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 1992] to [USGS Digital Line Graph (DLG-3, 1978) Series] road alignments using R-MATCH software developed by the Geographic Information Systems Group, University of Tennessee.
- [1993] Digitizing and conversion of state supplied digital and map data. Line work geodetically controlled to match [USGS Digital Line Graph (DLG-3, 1978) Series] line work.
- [1994] Integration of conflated version of [National Highway Planning Network V1.1, Bruce Peterson, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 1992] and assimilated State Departments of Transportation data into a comprehensive topologically integrated network database. States edgematched and National Highway System attributes verified.
- [1997] Integration of supplemental State Departments of Transportation data into the National Highway Planning Network Version 2. National Highway System attributes verified.
- [1998] Integration of intermodal connectors links into the National Highway Planning Network Version 2. States edgematched and National Highway System attributes verified.
- [2001] Update of National Highway System and Intermodal connector links into the National Highway Planning Network Version 4.0. States edgematched and National Highway System attributes verified.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Copied U.S. National Transportation Atlas Highways and symbolized interstates, four-lane roads and the rest uniquely. Selected and kept all interstates, major thoroughfares and any other road segments needed to represent the major drive patterns depicted in a typical highway road atlas. Several features had no route name and were given values from its neighboring features or by referencing the National Geographic Road Atlas. Corrected hundreds of gaps in the road network. Generalized to a tolerance of 0.003 decimal degrees. Added attributes CLASS, NUMBER, and SUFFIX from ESRI Data &amp; Maps 2002 U.S. National Transportation Atlas Interstate Highways based on the ROUTE_NUM attribute. Unsplit features based on combining all attributes. Added and calculated attributes DIST_MILES and DIST_KM. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC.</procdesc>
