        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Received an Excel file from Health Forum, L.L.C. Converted the file to dBASE (.dbf) and renamed the attributes. Removed features not in the fifty United States, District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Used the ESRI USA Address Locator to geocode the file using the address information included. Created the point shapefile from merging: 1) the locations from geocoding that matched to a street address, and 2) the locations from the latitude/longitude values included in the Excel file, when the address could only be geocoded using the ZIP Code or city value. Added the ADMIN_DESC and TYPE_DESC attributes getting their description values from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey Database documentation. Removed unneeded attributes and renamed and reordered the others. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
