Added attributes STATE_FIPS, CNTY_FIPS, STCOFIPS, TRACT, and BLOCK and created their values from parsing the values of the FIPS attribute.  Removed unneeded attributes.  Converted the data set to SDC.  Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The original U.S. Census Block Centroid layer was downloaded from the ESRI Data and Maps 2007 DVD in SDC (Smart Data Compression) format.  In order to create state-wide subsets of the large national-coverage dataset, the original layer was divided into individual state layers by running a script from Hawth's Tools v.3.27, based on the State FIPS code in the attribute table.  Each state layer was then exported into an ArcSDE 9.1 database using the Feature Class to Feature Class tool in ArcCatalog 9.2.</procdesc>
