  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Employment density for non-parkland area within the urban economic core: 1990, produced by the Central Transportation Planning Staff for the Metropolitan Area Planning Council. It was published by Central Transportation Planning Staff in 1994. Scale 1:17,000. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, drainage, cities and other human settlements, territorial boundaries, shoreline features, and more. Includes also employment density per 1,000 square feet of non-parkland area. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
