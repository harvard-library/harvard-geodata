Chose UTM Areas (utm_ply.shp) and added attributes East_value, Cm_value, and West_value from UTM zones (zone.shp).  Added filler values to attributes of the polygons in the north and south polar areas.  Removed unneeded attributes.  Created ArcGIS(tm) layer file (.lyr).  Created ArcView legend file (.avl).   Ran ArcView Avenue request ExportClean, and created spatial indices.</procdesc>

        <enttypd>The polygons represent the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zones, which, lie between 84 degrees north and 80 degrees south latitude. They divide the world into sixty zones, each of which is six degrees of longitude wide and is divided in half by a central meridian. The zones are numbered from 1 through 60 eastward from 180 degrees longitude. The zone characters designate eight degrees of latitude wide rows extending north and south from the equator.</enttypd>
