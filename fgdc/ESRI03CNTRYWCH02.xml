      <abstract>This polygon layer joins the CountryWatch Demographics attribute table to the ESRI Data &amp; Maps 2003 : World Countries 2002 datalayer, to enable spatial displaying of CountryWatch attributes.

CountryWatch Demographics (table) represents a vast amount of recent demographic information for the countries recognized by the U.S. State Department, including data on geography, population, social indicators, economy, key sectors of each economy and the environment. 

World Countries 2002 represents the boundaries for the countries of the world, as they existed in September 2002.</abstract>
      <purpose>The CountryWatch Demographics (table) provides geography, population, social indicators, economy, key sectors of each economy and the environment. To display CountryWatch Demographic attributes on a map, this table was joined to a World Countries attribute table using Fips_cntry or Cntry_name as the common field.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Largest scale when displaying the data: 1:15,000,000.</supplinf>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI for Data &amp; Maps 2002: Renamed Serbia and Montenegro to Yugoslavia.  Updated Fips_cntry attribute for East Timor and Yugoslavia.

The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted table from CountryWatch.com in an electronic mail system attachment. Renamed several attributes to match attribute names found in World Countries shapefiles. Added records of countries present in the World Countries shapefiles allowing a better match when joining those data sets to this table.  Added Cw_data attribute to show which records were from CountryWatch.com and which were supplied by ESRI.  Added Politi_map attribute. Added the values for the country records supplied by ESRI for attributes Fips_cntry, Cntry_name, Politi_map, and Cw_data. Calculated the values to -99, for the country records supplied by ESRI for all other attributes, to indicate data not supplied by CountryWatch.com. Edited the spelling of the names in the Cntry_name attribute to match names in the World Countries shapefiles.

Note: China and Taiwan are considered one country.  In the World Countries shapefiles they are two separate countries.</procdesc>

The layer was stored as a .dbf file on the DVD which was then joined to the "World Countries 2002" shapefile in ArcView 9.1 using the "Join" tool.  The joined data was exported to a new shapefile in ArcView, and then exported from ArcCatalog to an ArcSDE 9.0 database using the "Feature Class to Feature Class" export tool.</procdesc>

        <attrdef>The ratio of the urban population divided by the total population expressed as a percent. Usually the urban area is defined and the residual from the total population is taken as rural. In practice, the criteria adopted for distinguishing between urban and rural areas vary among countries. However, these criteria can be roughly divided into three major groups: classification of localities of a certain size as urban; classification of administrative centres of minor civil divisions as urban; and classification of centres of minor civil divisions on a chosen criterion which may include type of local government, number of inhabitants or proportion of population engaged in agriculture. Thus, the urban and rural population estimates in this domain are based on the varying national definitions of urban areas.

        <attrdef>The average annual number of deaths during a year per 1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate.

This indicator is significantly affected by age distribution, and most countries will eventually show a rise in the overall death rate, in spite of continued decline in mortality at all ages, as declining fertility results in an aging population.

        <attrlabl>GDP_99</attrlabl>
        <attrdef>The nominal productive capacity of a given country in billions of U.S. dollars.  The Gross Domestic Production (GDP) measures the value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. Estimates by CountryWatch.com of real GDP in most countries are  made by converting estimates by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the purchasing power parity value of GDP for a reference year for each country to a 1995 base through the use of the US GDP deflator. CIA reference year estimates of real GDP for most countries are given in the 2000 edition of the CIA World Factbook for years ranging from 1993 to 1999. The time series estimates for the years from 1995 to 1999 are generated for non reference year values by utilizing the real GDP growth rates for 1995-1999 given by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the May 2000 edition of the World Economic Outlook. Exceptions to this method were used for: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Nauru, Cuba, Palau, Holy See, San Marino, North Korea, Serbia &amp; Montenegro, Liberia, Somalia, Liechtenstein, Tonga, Monaco, Tuvalu. In these cases, the data on growth rates for these countries are not available so we cannot update the CIA World Fact Book Purchasing Power Parity Real GDP numbers to the latest year using our standard methodology. Therefore, we employ a method of estimating the economies' growth rates based upon data on output of key sectors of each economy which provides for a consistent methodology for all countries and a reasonable measure of economic growth.

The Gross Domestic Production (GDP) measures the value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year and a per capita adjustment normalizes this variable by population.

The PPP method involves the use of standardized international dollar price weights, which are applied to the quantities of final goods and services produced in a given economy.
