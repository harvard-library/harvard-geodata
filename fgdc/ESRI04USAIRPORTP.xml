      <abstract>U.S. GDT (Geographic Data Technology, Inc) Airports represents airport boundaries and airport runways within United States. All airports have a boundary and most have at least one runway.</abstract>
      <purpose>U.S. GDT Airports provides the boundaries for thousands of airports and runways. There are many attributes that describe each airport, for example, three or four character location id (airport code), owner, elevation, congestion level, large certified air carrier enplanements, foreign enplanements, hub size, and tower type.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Largest scale when displaying the data: 1:100,000.</supplinf>

Renamed most attributes and removed the rest. Converted Hawaii to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Corrected the most obvious airport name labeling errors:

Identified problem airports by visually reviewing the data and doing a point and polygon overlay with the NTAD 2002 Airport point data set. This yielded 30 potential locations. These 30 airports where also checked against the www.airnav.com web site for location code, name, geographic location and elevation. The airnav.com site displays current FFA information about airports.

In most cases the names were off because the data set contained the location name of airport rather than its 'official' name. The NTAD and AirNav airport names were the same in all cases. When the names were radically off it was because the airport location code was wrong. In extreme cases two separate airports would have the same location code and had been combined into a multi-part shape. In these cases the shapes were 'exploded' into their component parts and then recoded and renamed.

In two cases airports were deleted from the database. In both cases other sources of information (atlases, quad sheets, TerraServer, etc.) showed that no airport existed in that location or that it had been destroyed.

Some of the airports had runways but no surrounding airport area polygon. No attempt was made to correct the missing airport area polygons. To prevent duplicate labeling only the airport area (FCC = D58) has a name. These runway-only airports will not have a name. No check was made for the correct coding of FCC D58 and D59 codes.  

Any missing elevation values were corrected using information from the AirNav site.

In those cases where the location code was obviously incorrect the airport characteristics and transportation attributes for that airport were deleted.</procdesc>
