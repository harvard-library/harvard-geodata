      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The horizontal positional accuracy is difficult to determine since the boundaries may follow state, county, city, or other political boundaries. Still other times they may follow streets or other linear features in the database. Since these features are derived from different sources, it is not possible to give a single overall figure for horizontal accuracy.</horizpar>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The source of the Numbering Plan Areas (NPA) data is both North American Numbering Plan Association (NANPA) and the Local Exchange Routing Guide. We work closely with NANPA to keep these boundaries as accurate as possible.  There is really no source scale since the data is related to us as "a certain Rate Center is within a certain NPA area". The accuracy of the Rate Center and therefore the NPA boundaries is better defined by their position relative to other features. In other words, whether or not the boundary follows a street or a county boundary is the important factor.</procdesc>
