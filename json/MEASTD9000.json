  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer is a polygon coverage displaying Massachusetts towns and associated tabular data on rates of three sexually transmitted diseases (chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis) among adolescents (ages 15-19) from 1990 through 2000. These statistics were originally compiled and published by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health: Division of Research and Epidemiology. This layer was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database published by the Harvard Map Collection in 2001. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library.",
