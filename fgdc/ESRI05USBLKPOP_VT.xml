        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted the PL-94 data set from 2000 Census block centroids defined by the Census Bureau from the Public Law 94-171 population files. Created a nationwide file and combined state, county, tract, and block FIPS codes. Extracted the SF1 data set from the Census Bureau and created a nationwide file of the combined FIPS codes with POP2000, HOUSEHOLDS and HSE_UNITS attributes. Joined the files, formatted the attributes, created the Event Theme from the files, and output the shapefile. Converted Hawaii to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC.</procdesc>

Deleted points for counties (08001, 08013, 08059, 08123, 51005, and 51560) from U.S. Census Block Centroid Populations. Added the new counties block points into U.S. Census Block Centroid Populations. Converted the data set to SDC. Created the projection file (.prj) and spatial indices.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Started with the data set from ESRI Business Information Solutions. Added attributes STATE_FIPS, CNTY_FIPS, STCOFIPS, TRACT, and BLOCK and created their values from parsing the values of the FIPS attribute. Reordered the attributes. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The original U.S. Census Block Centroid layer was downloaded from the ESRI Data and Maps 2005 DVD in SDC (Smart Data Compression) format.  In order to create subsets of the large national-coverage dataset, the original layer was exported from SDC to Shapefile format and then divided by state by running a script based on the State FIPS code in the attribute table.  Each state layer was then exported into an ArcSDE 9.1 database using the "Feature Class to Feature Class" tool in ArcCatalog 9.2.</procdesc>
