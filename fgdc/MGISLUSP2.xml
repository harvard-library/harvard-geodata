      <abstract>The MassGIS Land Use datalayer has 37 land use classifications interpreted from 1:25,000 aerial photography. Coverage is complete statewide for 1971, 1985, and 1999.  Additionally, more than half the state was interpreted from aerial photography flown during 1990, 1991, 1992, 1995 or 1997. The 15 towns on Cape Cod also contain land use data for 1951.  Please see the Land Use Status Map (http://www.mass.gov/mgis/st_lus.htm), which displays the years for which land use data were interpreted for each town. 

The year of most recent photography used for land use data interpretation is stored in a single statewide coverage called LUSTAT (http://www.mass.gov/mgis/ftplus.htm). This layer was necessitated because some towns contain partial coverage for a certain year, which eliminated the one-to-one link between town-ID and year.</abstract>
      <purpose>The data set was developed for display and analysis using GIS.</purpose>

    <complete>Coverage is complete statewide for 1971, 1985, and 1999. Additionally, more than half the state was interpreted from aerial photography flown during 1990, 1991, 1992, 1995 or 1997. The 15 towns on Cape Cod also contain land use data for 1951. Please see the Land Use Status Map (http://www.mass.gov/mgis/st_lus.htm), which displays the years for which land use data were interpreted for each town.

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Photointerpretation and automation were done by the Resource Mapping Project at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. The RMP staff aggregated the 104 classes of their original 1971 interpretation into 21 categories and digitized the data into individual community digital coverages using a PC version of Arc/INFO software. The RMP staff then visually compared the 1971 photography and 1985 photography and produced a digital map of only 1971-85 change for each community. Interpretation was made from 1:40,000 9"x 9" color infrared photos flown in Summer 1985. Southeastern Mass was flown in September 1984. The flight and photography were funded by the Massachusetts Dept. of Environmental Management for another project. Several additional categories of land use were added for parts of Massachusetts. Ten communities in the Southeastern Regional Planning &amp; Economic Development District (SRPEDD) west of Buzzards Bay plus Bourne and Falmouth have a total of 28 land use classes. The 28 classes include the original 21 categories plus 23,24,25,26,27,28 and 29 (see Code Definitions below). 

In 1990, the Cape Cod Commission funded an update of Cape Cod. These data are categorized into 26 land use classifications, expanding the original codes to include 23,26,29 and 30. These additional codes, along with the original 21, are listed in LU37_CODE. The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) funded land use interpretation in 1991 for 14 towns. The 33 code scheme for this update includes codes 23,24,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36 and 37 in addition to the original 21 codes. The Executive Office of Transportation and Construction (EOTC) also funded a 1991 update for 113 towns using the same set of codes as the MWRA except for code 37. The UMass RMP staff updated some other towns not included in the 1990-1991 update based on digital orthophotography flown during 1992, 1995, and 1997. The towns that have been updated between 1985 and 1999 are listed below. The minimum mapping unit used was one acre. 

Each land use coverage was plotted at a scale of 1:25,000 by the RMP before delivery to MassGIS. MassGIS used a workstation version of Arc/INFO to combine data from different years. Each coverage, therefore, may contain many small polygons that may have been one land use type in, say, 1971. Over the years the land may have been split up for different uses, and the linework in the coverage reflects the land use boundaries for all these uses during the many years of interpretation. Because MassGIS maintains only one coverage per town, the most recent land use code (for 1999) is stored in the polygon's attribute table and the older codes are stored in a "polygon history table". The process of combining the data from different years created some 'sliver polygons'. These result when a theoretically coterminous line in each coverage is actually offset due to it having been digitized twice, e.g. the shore of a lake. Many of these slivers were eliminated by screening for an area/perimeter ratio beyond normal limits. 

NOTE: This project was funded by the Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs (EOEA), the Executive Office of Transportation and Construction, Massachusetts Water Resources Authority and several regional planning agencies. Photointerpretation and digitizing were completed by the UMASS-Amherst Department of Forestry Resource Mapping Project (RMP). 

In 1999, EOEA funded the acquisition of statewide 1:25,000 aerial color infrared photography for use in the latest round of land use interpretation. Again, photointerpretation and digitizing were completed by the UMASS Department of Forestry Resource Mapping Project. As part of the 1999 update RMP staff also removed slivers generated in earlier updates, fine-tuned edgematching between towns, and reinterpreted some historical land use codes.

The land use layer was previously stored in 351 individual town coverages named LUS in an ArcInfo Librarian layer named LANDUSE. The layer was combined into the statewide ArcSDE layer LANDUSE_POLY. The library layer only contained the latest year's land use code and all other years' codes were stored in a statewide "polygon history table". Individual history tables were also stored in INFO format, named LUS.PHS, in each town-based coverage's workspace. In ArcSDE the history table stores codes only for years other than 1971, 1985 and 1999. In addition to the statewide land use codes for 1971, 1985, and 1999, some towns have had land use interpreted for other years (1951, 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1997). To store these additional codes, a related "Polygon History table" (LANDUSE_POLY_HISTORY) was created (see MassGIS Web site: http://www.mass.gov/mgis/ftplus.htm to obtain table). The RELATEID field joins this table to the polygons. (The history table does not contain data for 1992. To obtain this data please contact MassGIS). Important note when joining to the historical land use tables: Users may need to define a query (e.g. a "definition query" in ArcMap) or select the history table records for a particular year and export the selected records to a new table, and then join the polygons to the subset of the table, for a one-to-one relationship between the tables for a single year</procdesc>
