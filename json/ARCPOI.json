Data displayed here was derived from the US Census Bureau SF-1 release of July, 2001. ARC documentation states that: This Theme originated from a list of regional landmarks generated by ARC staff. The point locations of these landmarks were digitized in ArcEdit using a variety of data sources, primarily ARC's street centerline database (ARCmap). The point locations are approximate centroids of the landmarks they represent.",
