        <procdesc>Michael Bauer Research GmbH established the data by reviewing relevant regional data and projecting the respective trends. For providing the most possible value to the user regarding comparability, all country results were projected by mathematical methods to the required geographical level, homogeneous base years, categories (e.g. age bands) and currency (Euro). Other remarks: - For Azerbaijan the number of households, dwellings and purchasing power growth rate are not surveyed. - For Vatican City only total population and population density are surveyed. - For Andorra, Liechtenstein, Georgia and San Marino the number of dwellings and purchasing power growth rate are not surveyed. - For Gibraltar the number of dwellings, purchasing power growth rate and gross domestic product are not surveyed. - For Monaco the purchasing power growth rate is not surveyed. - For Jersey, Guernsey and Isle of Man only total population, population density and population growth are surveyed. Michael Bauer Research GmbH provided Esri with:MBR - Economic and Sociodemographic Data for Europe (tables) and MBR - Digital Boundaries Maps for Europe, levels: NUTS 3, NUTS 2, NUTS 1, and NUTS 0 (shapefiles).</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by Esri: Started with the data in the custom package from Michael Bauer Research GmbH. The data included the four NUTS shapefiles and an Excel file that contained data for each of the four NUTS shapefiles. Joined each Excel table to its corresponding NUTS shapefile. For data sets NUTS 1, NUTS 2, and NUTS 3, added and coded the NUTS0 field. Renamed some fields. Added the SQKM field to each of the four data sets and calculated its values. Converted the data sets to SDC. Created ArcGIS? layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices for each data set.</procdesc>
