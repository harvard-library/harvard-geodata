  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Map of the town of Tiverton, Newport County, R.I., by Wm. G. Borden, civil engineer. It was published in 1854 by Friend & Aub. Scale [ca. 1:21,200]. Covers Tiverton, Rhode Island and a portion of Fall River, Massachusetts. 'Note: this map is partly from note furnished by H.F. Walling, civil engineer, and partly from original surveys.' The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Rhode Island State Plane Coordinate System (Feet) (FIPS 3800). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, drainage, selected private buildings labeled with owners' names, public buildings, churches, schools, industry locations (e.g. mills, factories, mines, etc.), cemeteries, town and school district boundaries, and more. Relief shown by hachures. Includes table and view of Oliver Chace's Thread Mill. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of New England from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
