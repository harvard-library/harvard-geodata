Layer features represent contiguous zoning districts as adopted in the zoning ordinance. The coverage is digitized from data collected from the existing zoning map from the Town's Planning Department, Boston Edison Company's street centerline datalayer, and the parcels datalayer. Zoning data includes polygons and labels representing the boundaries for specific zoning codes as defined by the Zoning Code.",
