Page in: The English pilot. The fourth book, 1764? Scale [ca. 1:90,000]. Covers Casco Bay, Maine with adjacent islands and shoreline. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM Zone 19N, meters, NAD 83). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows coastal features along Casco Bay including islands, points, coves, rocks, inlet rivers, low water marks, settlements, selected buildings, and more. Depths shown by soundings. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of New England from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features.
