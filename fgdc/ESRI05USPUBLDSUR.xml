Data from both sources were integrated into the 1:2,000,000-scale State boundary Digital Line Graph (DLG) files produced by the U.S. Geological Survey. The positional accuracy of the 1:2,000,000-scale State boundary Digital Line Graph (DLG) files is known to be 1,720 meters. The positional accuracies of the other sources are unknown.</horizpar>

Added attributes TOWNSHIP, RANGE, and TWNRNG and created their values from parsing the values of the FEATURE2 attribute. Reduced the attribute widths of FEATURE1, FEATURE2, FEATURE3, NAME1, NAME2, and STATE. Renamed attribute AREA to SQMI and calculated its values. Removed unneeded attributes. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
