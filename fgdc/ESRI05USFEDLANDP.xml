    <complete>After processing, the data set is checked for drawing display and number of records and file sizes compared with source materials. The minimum map resolution is 640 acres or one square mile. Generally, features under this size are not shown.

        <procdesc>The National Atlas file was originally compiled from 1:2,000,000-scale Digital Line Graph files produced in the early 1980's. Between 1997 and 2003, the file was updated multiple times using a variety of Federal and State sources, both to adjust boundaries and to add or delete areas as appropriate. The final version of this file was produced in October 2003. Using Wildlife refuge area updates from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Wilderness area updates from the USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute, and Wilderness area data from the National Wilderness Preservation System, the following updates were made: boundary updates to national wildlife refuges and wilderness areas; addition of several national wildlife refuges, waterfowl production areas, and wilderness areas; adjustment of wilderness study areas which had been converted to wilderness areas; and name corrections for several areas. Adjacent Federal lands having identical attributes were merged.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded the compressed file from http://www.nationalatlas.gov/atlasftp.html and extracted it. Combined attributes FEATURE1, 2, 3, AGBUR, NAME1, 2, 3, STATE, and STATE_FIPS into a single attribute, summarized and dissolved on that attribute to reduce the number of features. Joined the tables to get back the original attributes. Reduced the attribute widths of FEATURE1, 2, 3, AGBUR, NAME2, and NAME3. Added SQMI attribute and calculated its values. Added NAMEFLAG attribute and calculated its values. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
