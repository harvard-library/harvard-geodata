    <logic>No duplicate features are present. The shapefile is converted to SDC (Smart Data Compression) format in ArcSDE. This verifies and validates the geometry.</logic>

      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was extracted from the 2000 Census TIGER/Line files.  The positional accuracy of the TIGER/Line coordinates varies with the source materials used but at best meets the established National Map Accuracy standards (+/- 167 feet approximately) where 1:100,000-scale maps from the USGS are the source. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of feature updates added by its field staff or of features derived from the GBF/DIME-Files or other map sources. Thus, the level of positional accuracy in the TIGER/Line files is not suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted populated place areas from TANA/GDT Dynamap/2000 v. 15.0. Cleaned up the coastal areas. Attached and formatted the attributes from 2004 U.S. Populated Place Areas. For Puerto Rico, put "-99" values into all number attributes (except SQMI) and "unknown" values into the CLASS attribute. Created regions (multi-part) based on combining the STFIPS and PLACEFIP attributes. Renamed attributes AREANAME to NAME, POPULATION to POP2000, and POP_CL to POP_CLASS. Removed attributes AREALAND and AREAWATER. Added attributes SQMI and POP00_SQMI and calculated their values. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
