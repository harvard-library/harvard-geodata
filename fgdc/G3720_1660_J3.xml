      <abstract>This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Belgii novi, angliae novae, et partis Virginiae : novissima delineatio. It was published by Ioannes Ianssonius (Jan Jansson) between 1660 and 1663. Scale [ca. 1:2,450,000]. Covers the northeast Atlantic States from Maine to Virginia, and a portion of Canada. In Latin.

The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Mercator (world) projection. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map. 

This map shows features such as human settlements, forts, Native American tribal lands, drainage, shoreline features, and more. Relief is shown pictorially. Includes illustrations.

This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps of New England from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.</abstract>
      <purpose>Historic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred in the cultural and physical landscape. The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change. As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>The georeferenced raster is a faithfully reproduced digital image of the original source map. Some differences may be detected between the source graphic used and the raster image due to the RGB values assigned that particular color. The intent is to recreate those colors as near as possible.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <complete>Data completeness for raster digital image files reflect content of the source graphic. Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic due to scale and legibility constraints</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The horizontal positional accuracy of a raster image is approximately the same as the accuracy of the published source map.  The lack of a greater accuracy is largely the result of the inaccuracies with the original measurements and possible distortions in the original paper map document. There may also be errors introduced during the digitizing and georeferencing process.  In most cases, errors in the raster image are small compared with sources of error in the original map graphic.  The RMS error for this map is 10267.98809 meters.  This value describes how consistent the transformation is between the different control points (links).  The RMS error is only an assessment of the accuracy of the transformation.</horizpar>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Production of this raster image began with the scanning of the paper map on a high-resolution scanner: (Betterlight, Super8K2 scanning back camera and ViewFinder 5.x capture software).  Maps were photographed at a copy stand. A vacuum easel was used to keep the maps flat during photography. The imaging specification was designed to produce detailed "Archival Master" images that, to the extent possible, are faithful reproductions of the originals, and that allow for highly detailed screen reproduction and print reproduction at up 1:1. Images in this collection were processed using Adobe Photoshop. When possible files were batch processed using an "action" script derived from edits applied to match a representative sample. Color and tonal corrections were made using Adobe Photoshop. Image files were viewed on a calibrated monitor. Editing was performed in an ISO 3664 compliant proofing environment. Master Image files were corrected and archived as TIFF files in the sRGB IEC611966-2.1 color-space.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The digital TIFF image was georeferenced to common reference points located on digital vector shapefiles.  For this image, the following vector shapefiles were used as base maps for reference:  ESRI Data &amp; Maps 2005 : U.S. States (dtl_st.sdc) (1:100,000); and ESRI Data &amp; Maps 2005 : U.S. Rivers (Generalized) (rivers.sdc) (1:5,000,000).  The vector data was projected to Mercator (world), meters, Datum: WGS 1984, and the images were subsequently georeferenced to the same projection.   ArcMap 9.1 software was utilized for the georeferencing process, and a .tfw (world file) was automatically generated and saved in association with the digital image.  Please note that while the image is stored in Mercator (world) projection coordinates, the projection will need to be defined by the user in order to display the image with other projected data.</procdesc>

      <eaover>The indexes reference a color palette of RGB values from 0 through 255, representing the color value from the original paper sheet map. The colors on that sheet can represent relief, drainage, vegetation, populated places, cultural features, coastal hydrography, transportation features (roads, railroads, tracks and trails), spot elevations and boundaries. The colors are sometimes explained in a legend that is incorporated into the map inset or collar.</eaover>
