    <descript>
      <abstract>U.S. Core Based Statistical Areas represents geographic entities, defined by the United States Office of Management and Budget for use by Federal statistical agencies, based on the concept of a core area with a large population nucleus, plus adjacent communities having a high degree of economic and social integration with that core. A Core-Based Statistical Area consists of a county containing an Incorporated Place or Census Designated Place with a population of at least 10,000 along with any adjacent counties that have at least 25 percent of employed residents of the county who work in the CBSA's core or central county. CBSAs are categorized as being either Metropolitan or Micropolitan. Each Metropolitan Statistical Area must have at least one urbanized area of 50,000 or more inhabitants. Each Micropolitan Statistical Area must have at least one urban cluster of at least 10,000 but less than 50,000 population.</abstract>
      <purpose>U.S. Core Based Statistical Areas provides the names and types of core-based statistical areas.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Largest scale when displaying the data: 1:100,000.</supplinf>

        <horizpar>CBSA polygons are built from TANA/GDT County boundaries.

The geospatial part of this data set was extracted from the 2002 Census TIGER/Line files. The positional accuracy of the TIGER/Line coordinates varies with the source materials used but at best meets the established National Map Accuracy standards (+/- 167 feet approximately) where 1:100,000-scale maps from the USGS are the source. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of feature updates added by its field staff or of features derived from the GBF/DIME-Files or other map sources. Thus, the level of positional accuracy in the TIGER/Line files is not suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.</horizpar>

Contiguous multiple polygons are not present. Areas outside of defined CBSAs are represented as holes. All inventory centroids fall inside the polygon that represents the CBSA. If there are multiple polygons for a
CBSA then it will fall inside the largest polygon.</procdesc>

Removed "Micropolitan Statistical Area" and "Metropolitan Statistical Area" text from the NAME attribute. Added attribute POP2004 and calculated its values by summarizing county populations using the ESRI Business Information Solutions CBSA/county correspondence table. Added attribute SQMI and calculated its values. Added attribute POP04_SQMI and calculated its values. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
