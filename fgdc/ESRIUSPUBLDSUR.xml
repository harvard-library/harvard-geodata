        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was originally extracted from 1:500,000 and 1:1,000,000-scale state base maps for the western U.S. states and USGS topographic 1:100,000-scale maps for the eastern U.S. states.  Data from both sources were integrated into the 1:2,000,000-scale State boundary Digital Line Graph (DLG) files produced by the U.S. Geological Survey.  The positional accuracy of the 1:2,000,000-scale State boundary Digital Line Graph (DLG) files is known to be 1,720 meters.  The positional accuracies of the other sources are unknown.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>The Public Land Survey data was collected from 1:500,000 and 1:1,000,000-scale state base maps for the western U.S. states and USGS topographic 1:100,000-scale maps for the eastern U.S. states.  Data from both sources was integrated into 1:2,000,000-scale State boundary Digital Line Graph (DLG) files, then generalized and vertically integrated with 1:2,000,000-scale Digital Line Graph Data-Boundaries, County Boundaries of the United States, and Hydrography Features of the United States.  The resulting Public Land Survey System DLG files were published on CD-ROM in 1995.  The DLG optional format files were then converted to ARC/INFO coverages, and the individual state files were paneled together into a national coverage.  Numeric DLG codes were translated into English, and only polygon features were included in the national coverage.</procdesc>

Removed unneeded attributes.  Aggregated features based on each attribute.  Reduced the width of attributes.  Created ArcGIS(tm) layer file (.lyr).  Created ArcView legend file (.avl).
