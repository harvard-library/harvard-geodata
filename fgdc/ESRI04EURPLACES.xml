        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted eur5_p.shp from AND Global Road Data. Removed all features where values of LEVEL attribute exceed 2. Created NAME attribute from combining NAMEPRE and NAME attributes. Added the CNTRYNAME attribute from Europe Countries. Added CAPITAL attribute from TYPE attribute. Added DUP_NAME attribute based on NAME attribute. Added the PROV1NAME attribute from Europe Level 1 Provinces. Added POP_CLASS attribute and populated it based on TYPE attribute and from Europe Cities. Rearranged and renamed the attributes. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC.</procdesc>
