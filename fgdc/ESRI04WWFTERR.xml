      <abstract>World Wildlife Fund Terrestrial Ecoregions represents global terrestrial ecoregions. Ecoregions are defined as relatively large areas of land or water in the world containing a characteristic set of natural communities that share a large majority of their species, dynamics, and environmental conditions. This data set contains all terrestrial ecoregions, which include those of the Global 200. Global 200 ecoregions are a collection of the Earth's most outstanding and diverse terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitats where the Earth's biological wealth is most distinctive and rich, where its loss will be most severely felt, and we must protect if we are to preserve the web of life. For more information, contact http://www.worldwildlife.org.</abstract>
      <purpose>World Wildlife Fund Terrestrial Ecoregions provides a global view of terrestrial ecoregions defined by the World Wildlife Fund Conservation Science Program 2001, and can be used for geographic display and analysis at national and world levels.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Largest scale when displaying the data: 1:3,000,000.</supplinf>

        <procdesc>We began by accepting the biogeographic realms of Pielou (1979) and Udvardy (1975) and modifying the biome systems of Dinerstein et al. (1995) and Ricketts et al. (1999). We then consulted existing global maps of floristic or zoogeographic provinces, global and regional maps of units based on the distribution of selected groups of plants and animals, the world's biotic province maps, and global maps of broad vegetation types. These were useful for evaluating the extent of realms and biomes, the first two tiers in our hierarchical classification. 

We then identified published regional classification systems to be used as a baseline for ecoregion boundaries. Data and consultations from regional experts were also important for final ecoregion delineations.</procdesc>
