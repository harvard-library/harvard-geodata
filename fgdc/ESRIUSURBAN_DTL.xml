        <procdesc>Urban polygons from the Digital Chart of the World (DCW) CD-ROM were extracted and converted to ARC/INFO format.  Where the urban boundaries extend beyond the 1:2,000,000-scale shoreline, the 1:2,000,000-scale shoreline was used by "CLIPPING" the urban polygons.  Names of the urban areas were added. In large metropolitan areas many smaller areas were labeled as part of the metropolitan area.  The state in which the urban area is located was also added.  Several areas were modified to conform to the 1:2,000,000-scale hydrography layer.  Some smaller polygons that represent undeveloped areas within the urban area were removed and merged with the larger urban area.  Military reservations were removed.   Revisions: 1)   6/29/98 - Corrected ellipsoid name from WGS84 to GRS1980 and changed flattening ratio. 2) 11/13/98 - Added State FIPS attribute; moved polygons for Altus, OK and Olustee, OK; and edited State attribute for Kansas City and Washington metro area.</procdesc>
