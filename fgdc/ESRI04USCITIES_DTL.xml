      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Digitized place names from the 1970 National Atlas of the United States were compared with U.S. Census Bureau place names from the Codes for Named Populated Places (FIPS 55-DC3). Where there were discrepancies, names from the Geographic Names Information System were used. A small number of places could not be assigned FIPS-55-DC3 codes and were removed from the data set. Minor positional corrections were also made.

No spatial data was changed in Cities and Towns of the United States 1998. The following edits were made to the Cities and Towns of the United States 1998 attribute data base file. In the Feature field, inconsistencies were removed and the population ranges were corrected as necessary to match the 1990 population information in the Pop field. Unnecessary fields were deleted (Idnum, Capcode, Stid). Fields were added for State, State_Fips, and County. Lakewood Center, Washington was changed to Lakewood, Washington with a population of 58412. Incorrect population information for Lakewood, Snohomish County was deleted. Boise City, Idaho was changed to Boise, Idaho.
 
Points generated from the U.S. Gazetteer Place File 1990 text file were added to Cities and Towns of the United States 2000; points with duplicate FIPS55 codes were removed. County, State, and FIPS data from Cities and Towns of the United States 2000 were compared and corrected, if necessary, with data from FIPS55-3 index, and with the populated place text file (pop_places_deci) from the Geographic Names Information System anonymous ftp site. Remaining incorporated and Census Designated Places (CDP's) from Geographic Names Information System were added; all unincorporated and non-CDP places were then removed from Cities and Towns of the United States 2000. A few populated places in high density areas were filtered out. Population data from the Population Estimates for Places: July 1, 1998, and Population Change: April 1, 1990 to July 1, 1998 and U.S. Gazetteer Place File 1990 files were added to Cities and Towns of the United States 2000 (a population value of -99999 was used where population data was not available). Some places were updated with new FIPS55 codes since the last online release (1998). Minor positional corrections were made using Hydrography Features of the United States and County Boundaries of the United States as references. A display attribute, based on population size and distance to nearest town, was added to determine which place names will be shown at the most detailed scale on the National Atlas interactive map browser.</procdesc>

Removed unneeded attributes. Combined the values from POP_RANGE_ and FEATURE attributes and put the values into the FEATURE attribute. Recoded POP_98 attribute values of -99999 to 0. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC.</procdesc>
