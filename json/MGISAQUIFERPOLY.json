  "dc_description_s": "MassGIS produced an aquifer datalayer composed of 20 individual panels, generally based on the boundaries of the major drainage basins. Areas of high and medium yield were mapped. For the purpose of identifying areas in which clean up of hazardous waste sites must meet drinking water standards, as defined in the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (MCP) (310 CMR 40.0000), the DEP has coded polygons within the aquifer coverage to identify 'Non Potential Drinking Water Source Areas' (NPDWSAs). NPDWSAs include any Potentially Productive Aquifer or portion thereof which underlies land areas of at least 100 acres developed for one or more of the following uses as of January 1, 1996: Industry; Commerce; Dense residential development and associated uses; transportation; or Urban open space; and those portions of Potentially Productive Aquifers that underlie US Census block groups with population densities of greater than 4,400 persons/square mile. Polygons where the item NPDWSA = 1 are designated as NPDWSAs. Polygons where the item NPDWSA = 0 are not designated as NPDWSAs.",
