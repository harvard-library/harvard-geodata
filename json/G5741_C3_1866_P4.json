  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: To her Most Excellent Majesty Queen Victoria this hydrographical map of the British Isles, exhibiting the geographical distribution of the inland waters : constructed by Augustus Petermann, F.R.G.C.S. ... is most humbly dedcated by the Author. It was published by Published by Edward Stanford, Charing Cross in 1866. Scale 1:1,600,000 (about 25 miles to 1 inch). The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the 'British National Grid' coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, cities and other human settlements, territorial boundaries, shoreline features, and more. Includes also diagram showing the comparative fall of the principal rivers of the British Isles and diagram showing the ascent and descent of canals remarkable for their great elevation or steepness. Includes also notes and table with statistical information about rivers. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
