      <abstract>This datalayer is a polygon coverage displaying Major Watersheds throughout Massachusetts. 
The data here were originally produced by MassGIS. MassGIS has produced a statewide digital datalayer of the 32 major watersheds covering  Massachusetts. The datalayer is called WATRSHDS. Unlike the Major Drainage Basins layer, the watersheds in this layer extend beyond the state boundary to include the full extent of either the full watershed or a full USGS sub-basin.

MassGIS defines Watersheds (as well as Drainage Basins), using the USGS Water Resources Division definition, as "The land area drained by a river or stream." 
Related terms are: 
Drainage area: "The drainage area of a stream at a specified location is that area, measured in a horizontal plane, which is enclosed by a drainage divide." and, 
Drainage divide: "Boundary between adjoining drainage basins"

This layer was derived from the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) which was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library.

For more information on the original MassGIS datalayer please consult their website at: http://www.state.ma.us/mgis/watrshds.htm</abstract>
      <purpose>This layer is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political anaylsis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.</purpose>

The attribute accuracy of these files is as precise as the source used during the creation or update of the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) database. No specific field tests for attribute accuracy have been conducted on the files.

The Watershed Names are keyed to the BASIN NAME attributes appearing on other related MassGIS datalayers.

    <complete>Data completeness of the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) files reflects the contents of the database at the time the files were created. Data for a given category contain attribute codes that reflect the information portrayed on the original source.
MassGIS is maintaining the original datalayer. In February 2002 the DEP GIS Group modified some linework within the USGS Woronoco (#33) Quadrangle to synchronize the major basin divide with changes in the DEP Surface Water Supply Protection Area datalayers (Zone A, B, C) and Sub-basin tiles. In May 2002 the DEP GIS Group revised the N. Coastal/Ipswich basin boundary in Wenham. In March 2003 linework was updated along the Westfield/Connecticut and N. Coastal/Ipswich boundaries.</complete>

      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas' (MEA) mission to profile the Commonwealth's people and institutions did not require the highest level of positional accuracy.  Coordinates in these files are in decimal degrees and have six implied decimal places.  The six-decimal place precision is useful when producing maps as it allows you to place features that are next to each other on the ground in the correct position, relative to each other, on the map without overlap.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>A set of 1:24,000 USGS paper quad sheets was carefully delineated with approximately 1800 minor or sub- drainage basins. This work was produced over the past 20 years by the USGS-WRD. Generally, the contours on the quads are the primary guide to basin boundaries. Often the 'mouth' of a basin is marked at the site of a stream gauging station, which can be different from the strict geographic location of the mouth.since the DLGs were produced. These changes were compiled onto 1:25,000 quad sheets, digitized, and appended into the datalayer.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The WATRSHDS layer was originally based on the MAJ_BAS layer and then modified to fit the needs of the MassGIS Watershed Analyst project. The state boundary was removed from MAJ_BAS and the existing internal watershed boundaries were modified or adjusted to conform to the 1:25,000 Hydrography layer. To produce the watershed boundaries that extend beyond the state boundary, sub-basin data from the adjacent state GIS databases were incorporated. Some of these were adjusted to conform to the Networked Hydro Centerlines data, which was developed for use in the Watershed Analyst. These data are used for modeling stream flow. See the Watershed Analyst section (http://www.state.ma.us/mgis/vwr_wa.htm) for more details. In some cases, the out-of-state sub-basins were clipped to include data that affect stream flow into or out of Massachusetts. In addition, the coastline was buffered for generalization. Non-contiguous basins, such as the two parts of the North Coastal watershed, were combined and connected with the coastal buffer to conform to the naming scheme as defined in the Stream and River Information System (SARIS).

The major basins were produced from the sub-basins (derived from the USGS-WRD work) using the Arc/INFO Dissolve command. This removed all lines except boundaries between major basins. This was possible because the Major Basin # is encrypted in the Sub-Basin-ID.
The resulting Massachusetts internal major basin boundaries were then appended to the state outline and shoreline, and processed to result in a statewide polygon datalayer, which is a digital facsimile of the Massachusetts Water Resources Commission official Massachusetts Drainage Basins Map. 
All sub-basins on the manuscripts were digitized (refer to SUB-BASINS Datalayer description available at MassGIS website). Due to good manuscript quality, including the visual edgematching of the 189 sheets, digitizing and edgematching was straightforward. The manuscript author was consulted on the minor errors and ambiguities that were discovered.</procdesc>
