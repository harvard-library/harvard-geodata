    <descript>
      <abstract>World Latitude and Longitude Grids represents a 1- by 1-degree latitude-longitude grid covering the world with attributes that allow it to display grids at intervals of 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 degrees. To display a grid with a 1-degree interval, simply display all of the lines. To display a coarser grid (e.g., a 15-degree interval), in the Layer Properties dialog box, add the DEGREE15 attribute value equal to Y.</abstract>
      <purpose>World Latitude and Longitude Grids provides latitude and longitude lines for use as an overlay for world-level maps.</purpose>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by Esri: Created the 1- by 1-degree grid data set using the ArcInfo Generate tool. Used projection, coordinate, and attribute information from the Esri Data &amp; Maps 10 World Latitude and Longitude Grids data set. Added and coded the attributes VALUE, DEGREE5, DEGREE10, DEGREE15, DEGREE20, and DEGREE30. Converted the data set to SDC. Copied the projection file (.prj), and created the ArcGIS layer file (.lyr) and spatial indices.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>This layer was downloaded from the Esri Data and Maps 10.1 DVD.  The layer was originally stored in an SDC (Smart Data Compression) format.
