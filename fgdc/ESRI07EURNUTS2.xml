        <procdesc>Michael Bauer Research GmbH established the data by reviewing relevant regional data and projecting the respective trends. For providing the most possible value to the user regarding comparability, all country results were projected by mathematical methods to the required geographical level, homogeneous base years, categories (e.g. age bands) and currency (Euro).

Other remarks:
 - For Azerbaijan only population data, gross domestic product, and employed persons are surveyed.
 - For Georgia only population data, households, gross domestic product, and employed are surveyed.
 - For Vatican City only population and population density are surveyed.
 - For Andorra, Gibraltar, Liechtenstein and San Marino the number of dwellings and purchasing power growth rate are not surveyed.
 - For Monaco the purchasing power growth rate is not surveyed.
 - In Russia only the European part of the country is surveyed (in accordance with the maps).

Michael Bauer Research GmbH provided ESRI with:
MBR - Economic and Sociodemographic Data for Europe and EuroBoundaryMap boundary data from EuroGeographics in the NUTS 0, NUTS 1, NUTS 2, and NUTS 3 shapefiles and table.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Started with the data in the custom package from Michael Bauer Research GmbH and EuroGeographics. The data included the four NUTS shapefiles and an Excel file that contained data for each of the four NUTS shapefiles. Converted the Excel file into four dBASE (.dbf) files. Joined each .dbf file to its corresponding NUTS shapefile. Added the arctic islands of Russia and Svalbard and Jan Mayen and the country of Armenia from the AND Global Road Data to each of the four NUTS shapefiles. Coded their attributes with '-99' (null) values. For data sets NUTS 1, NUTS 2, and NUTS 3, added and coded the NUTS0 attribute. Added the SQKM attribute to each of the four data sets and calculated its values. Converted the data sets to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices for each data set.</procdesc>
