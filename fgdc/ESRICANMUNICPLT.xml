        <procdesc>The data set is a fully georeferenced, purely digital product. The boundaries are digitized from CanMap(r). Source data ranges from municipal mapping at a very large scale of 1:2,000 or larger, to a medium scale of 1:50,000 scale from NTDB*.  Source time period of content ranges from a few to several years (as in the case of NTDB*).   *NTDB is the National Topographic Data Base, developed and maintained by Natural Resources Canada.</procdesc>
