        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted the features from ESRI Data &amp; Maps 1999 data set-admin98.shp.  Updated political boundaries for countries and first-level administrative units.  Used Region attribute to dissolve out the necessary features to create the regions. Removed unnecessary attributes. Created ArcGIS(tm) layer file (.lyr).  Created ArcView legend file (.avl).  Created projection file (.prj).  Created spatial indices.</procdesc>
