        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by Esri: Extracted the data set from the subset of DeLorme World Base Map (DWBM). Added field TYPE and calculated its values using the source DFCC code and descriptive look up table. Added field RANK and calculated its values based on the source field LOI which numerically ranks feature importance using a DeLorme numbering scheme. Deleted all fields except NAME, ISO_CC, TYPE, and RANK. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
