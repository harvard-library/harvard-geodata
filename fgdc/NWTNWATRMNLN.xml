      <abstract>This line data layer contains Newton's water distribution system mains and pipes.  A second, related layer (Water Distribution System, Points) includes data for various types of water valves, meter pits, blow offs, pump stations, and water towers.</abstract>
      <purpose>This layer is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data.

This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to utilities and municipal engineering purposes as well as urban planning or public works purposes (including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.)</purpose>
      <supplinf>The city will be maintaining this data layer using information from city crews and from contractor crews.  The current intent is for this maintenance to be performed using the V7ARC application purchased from Hansen, Inc.  At this time that application is not working correctly, and maintenance is not occurring.</supplinf>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Hydrant attributes originally included the same hydrant number that appeared in the Engineering Dept. version of the atlas.
However it turned out that these numbers were unique only within an atlas sheet.  Therefore, the hydrants were re-numbered with a unique sequential number.  The number from the atlas has been retained as the old.</attraccr>

    <logic>For layers containing line or polygon features, Newton's data layers are "topologically clean". This was verified with Arc/Info software version 7.x in 1998 and is an ongoing part of data maintenance for the relevant data layers.</logic>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>Valve locations mapped based on photogrammetric locations have an absolute accuracy of +/- 2.5 feet.  Each valve has an attribute indicating whether its location was moved to that of a photo location.  The accuracy of the other valve locations is unknown.  The intent, with respect to the accuracy of the water main locations, was only to ensure that if a main existed in a street right-of-way or between two valves, it appeared in the GIS data layer.  In cases where a main connects two valves whose position was mapped from the aerial photography in a straight line, the main may be within 2 ? feet of its actual location.

The information below is from the J. W. Sewall Co. Aerial Photography Proposal Documents:
Scale of Photography: 1:7200
Forward Overlap: 60% average within 5 feet.
Side Overlap: 30% average within 10 feet
Tilt: Not to exceed 3 degrees - 4 degrees between flight lines
Crab: Not to exceed 3 degrees relative to flight line
Contact Prints: 9" x 9" received from company.
Ground Control: Primary - 12 permanent control markers set - 36" concrete monuments. GPS network of 50 stations with three horizontal and nine vertical ties to grid. Network tied to MSPCS NAD83 datum and NGVD29 datum by occupying Mass. Highway Department control points.
Block Adjustment Accuracy: Horizontal: second order class I; Vertical: third order 
Model: ALBANY-Lite
Final Pixel Size: 12 inches
Final Horizontal Accuracy: Approximately +/- 5 feet.</horizpar>

        <srccontr>31 CAD files (one per map sheet) of the water system were converted from DXF format to Arc/Info format and merged into a single data layer. Arc-node topology was created from the node and line symbol layers in the CAD files</srccontr>
      </srcinfo>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>There were two kinds of source materials.  The first was computer files in CAD format of the water system; SEA Consultants, Inc developed them in 1991.  The other source was point locations for valves and hydrants mapped photogrammetrically from the city's 1994 aerial photography by James.W. Sewall Co.  Before the photographs were taken, the valves and hydrants were identified with a painted target that would be visible on the photos when they were viewed through a stereoplotter.  A field check of the area on four non-contiguous 1" = 40' scale Assessor's map sheets showed that about 73% of the valves were mapped correctly.  This result was low for several reasons: the valve target was small, there were problems with shadows and cars hiding targeted and un-targeted valves, and it is easy to confuse Boston Gas Company valves with water valves.  In addition, valves are often paved over.  A field check of hydrant mapping results showed that for four 1" = 40' scale Assessor's maps, about 84% of the hydrants were correctly mapped. 

The 31 CAD files (one per map sheet) were converted from DXF format to Arc/Info format and merged into a single data layer.  Pipe features were checked to make sure they ran seamlessly across sheet boundaries.  Arc-node topology was created from the node and line symbol layers in the CAD files; valves and hydrants were represented as nodes in the arc-node topology.  Then valve and hydrant locations in the Arc/Info file were adjusted, when appropriate, to match the location of a point from the photography.  Features converted from the CAD files also include blow-offs and check valves.

In 1998, because of requirements of hydrologic modeling software and the Hansen Infrastructure Management System database, the hydrants were converted from node features to point features. This was accomplished by using the Arc command nodepoint to create a point layer from the arc nodes in the water system data layer; these points were then edited so they contained only hydrants; they were then added back into the water system coverage.  Subsequently, the hydrant nodes were removed from the water main network (lines) data layer and, at that time, hydrant feeder pipes were also removed from the water system pipe network.</procdesc>
