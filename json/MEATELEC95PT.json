Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical (SIC Code 381): Establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing search, detection, navigation, guidance, aeronautical, and nautical systems and instruments.

Statewide employment in the telecommunications industry grew by an astounding 71 percent between 1993 and 1997. Rapid increase in telecommunications equipment and services spending will likely lead to further economic growth, especially for the Boston region This dataset was originally prepared by the Center for Labor Market Studies, Northeastern University and distributed by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council in 1996. It was published as part of the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database in 2001. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library. The Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) is a regional planning agency representing 101 cities and towns in the metropolitan Boston area. Created by an act of the Legislature in 1963, it serves as a forum for state and local officials to address issues of regional importance. As one of 14 members of the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO), MAPC has oversight responsibility for the region's federally funded transportation program Stretching west from Boston to include most of the communities inside the I-495 corridor, the MAPC planning area consists of 22 cities and 79 towns. Coastal communities, older industrial centers, rural towns, and modern cities are represented within the 1,422 square miles that comprise the MAPC region.",
