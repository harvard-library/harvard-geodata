Osborne ; drawn by E.M. Woodford, civl. enginr. It was published by Richard Clark in 1855. Scale [ca. 1:19,800]. This layer is image 1 of 2 total images, representing the western portion of the two sheet source map. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map.
