  <dataqual>
    <logic>The shapefile is converted to SDC (Smart Data Compression) format using tools in ArcGIS.  The SDC data set is then imported into a file geodatabase to verify, validate, and if needed repair the geometry.The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical consistency and limits of shapefiles and performed spatial data tests for logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original Census MAF/TIGER database files.</logic>
    <complete>After processing, the data set is checked for drawing display and number of records and file sizes compared with source materials.[Applies to the coastline only - Line simplification and smoothing was performed with a tolerance of 0.005 decimal degrees and a coordinate reduction using the Douglas-Peucker method with a tolerance of 0.0003 decimal degrees. Very small polygons were eliminated when the combination of geographic codes existed elsewhere.]</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>Coordinates in the TIGER/Line shapefiles have six implied decimal places, but the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as the six decimal places suggest. The positional accuracy is unknown.</horizpar>
