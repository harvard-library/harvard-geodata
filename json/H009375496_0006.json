  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of a map plate of a section of Alexandria, Egypt from the Charles E. Goad map set entitled: Insurance plan of Alexandria Egypt, Vol. 1, published April 1910. This image is of Plate 4 (Minet El Bassal). Scale 1:600. Covers the central part of Alexandria.The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Egypt Red Belt projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map.
