  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays the non-visible features for the state of Virginia. This layer contains various types of nonvisible lines used to maintain the topology in the Census TIGER database. Non-visible features are used to delimit tabulation entities, property areas, legal and administrative entities. The U.S. Census Bureau separately identifies non-visible boundaries only when they do not follow a visible feature such as a road, stream, or ridge line. The predominant Census Feature Class Codes (CFCC) in this layer include: F10 (Non-visible jurisdictional boundary of a legal or administrative entity); F23 (Closure extension to complete database topological closure between extremely close features - used to close small gaps between complete chains and create polygons to improve block labeling on cartographic products); F40 (Property line, non-visible boundary of either public or private lands, e.g., a park boundary); F71 (1980 statistical boundary); F72 (1990 statistical boundary; used to hold 1990 collection and tabulation census block boundaries not represented by existing physical features); F73 (Internal U.S. Census Bureau use) and F81 (School district boundary).",
