It was published by Richard Clark in 1855. Scale [ca. 1:15,840]. This layer is image 1 of 2 total images, representing the southern portion of the two sheet source map. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001).
