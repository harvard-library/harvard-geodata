        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was calculated from latitude/longitude coordinates. The positional accuracy is unknown.

Note that some locations are the center point of broad volcanic fields, and that even at individual volcanoes the coordinates given do not necessarily match the eruption site. Tens of kilometers may separate eruptive centers of a single volcano, particularly in large caldera complexes and rift settings.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>The data were copied from the Smithsonian Institution, Global Volcanism Program Web site into a text file. West longitude and south latitude values were converted to negative values. The file was loaded into ArcView GIS and a shapefile was created. Using North America Shaded Relief map for reference, the location of Mount Rainier was adjusted slightly.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded the ArcView GIS Shapefile compressed file, volcanx020.tar.gz, from http://www.nationalatlas.gov/atlasftp.html and extracted it. Removed features not in the United States or its territories. Added STATE, KNOWN_ERUP and MAX_VEI attributes from ESRI Data &amp; Maps 2002 U.S. National Atlas Volcanoes. For the four records that did not match, attribute STATE was coded from the LOCATION attribute and attributes ELEVATION, KNOWN_ERUP, and MAX_VEI were coded, -99999,  -999, and -999 respectively. Rearranged and removed attributes to match the last release. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC.</procdesc>

            <edomv>Shield volcano(es)</edomv>
            <edomvd>A volcano that resembles an inverted warrior's shield, with broad, gentle slopes, built by multiple eruptions of fluid basalt lava. Basalt lava tends to build enormous, low-angle cones because it flows across the ground easily and can form lava tubes that enable lava to flow tens of kilometers from an erupting vent with very little cooling.</edomvd>

            <edomvd>A steep-sided volcano built by lava flows and tephra deposits. Tephra is solid material of all sizes explosively ejected from a volcano into the atmosphere.</edomvd>
