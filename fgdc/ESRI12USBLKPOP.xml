        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by Esri: Created the block centroids from the 2010 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File. Reordered and renamed the fields. Added fields STATE_FIPS, CNTY_FIPS, STCOFIPS, TRACT, and BLOCK and created their values from parsing the values of the FIPS field. Projected the data set to World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS 1984). Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
