Covers the City of Boston and portions of adjacent towns and cities: Chelsea, Everett, Somerville, Cambridge, Watertown, Belmont, Newton, Brookline, Milton, and Quincy, Massachusetts. Scale [1:19,800]. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map.
