        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded the data set from the Delorme FTP site. Added field TYPE and calculated its values using the source DFCC code and descriptive look up table. Renamed field ACC to RANK. Deleted all fields except TYPE, RANK, NAME1, NAME2, and NAME3. Dissolved features on all fields to reduce the number of features. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
