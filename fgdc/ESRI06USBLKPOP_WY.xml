      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted the block inventory (block points that include centroid latitude and longitude coordinates) files from Dynamap/Census Boundaries v. 6.0.  Merged the block points into a national shapefile.  Checked that all the block points reside within the correct block group polygons using a spatial overlay.  As a result: 1) corrected latitude and longitude coordinate errors for features in Alaska, and 2) moved block points that were in the incorrect block group and updated the latitude and longitude values of the block points.  Attached the U.S. Census SF1 attributes POP2000, HSE_UNITS, and HOUSEHOLDS.  Added attributes STATE_FIPS, CNTY_FIPS, STCOFIPS, TRACT, and BLOCK and created their values from parsing the values of the FIPS attribute.  Converted the data set to SDC.  Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The original U.S. Census Block Centroid layer was downloaded from the ESRI Data and Maps 2006 DVD in SDC (Smart Data Compression) format.  In order to create state-wide subsets of the large national-coverage dataset, the original layer was exported from SDC to Shapefile format and then divided by state by running a script based on the State FIPS code in the attribute table.  Each state layer was then exported into an ArcSDE 9.1 database using the Feature Class to Feature Class tool in ArcCatalog 9.2.</procdesc>
