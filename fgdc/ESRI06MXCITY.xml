        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded the data set from the Sistemas de Informacion Geografica, S.A. de C.V. FTP site.  Renamed attribute names in Spanish to English.  Translated the Spanish values in the OBJETO attribute to English and put them in the POP_RANGE attribute.  Added attribute ALT_NAME and created its values from parsing the alternative name values in the NAME attribute.  Made the attribute values title case that were uppercase.  Converted the data set to SDC.  Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
