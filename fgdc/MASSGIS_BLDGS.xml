      <abstract>This dataset consists of 2D footprints of the buildings in the metropolitan Boston area, based on tiles in the orthoimage index (orthophoto quad ID: 229890, 229894, 229898, 229902, 233886, 233890, 233894, 233898, 233902, 237890, 237894, 237898, 237902, 241890, 241894, 241898, 241902, 245898, 245902).  This data set was collected using 3Di's Digital Airborne Topographic Imaging System II (DATIS II).

Roof height and footprint elevation attributes (derived from 1-meter resolution LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) data) are included as part of each building feature. This data can be combined with other datasets to create 3D representations of buildings and the surrounding environment.</abstract>
      <purpose>The data was collected for MassGIS to be used for a variety of purposes including emergency response planning, hydrologic / floodplain modeling, assessment of natural hazards, and impervious surface delineation.</purpose>

      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The 3Di DATIS LIDAR system used multiple layers of system calibration to ensure horizontal accuracy.  The initial instrument calibration was accomplished during the system fabrication.  All critical components (IMU, LIDAR, Camera, and Scanner) were optically aligned to a common optical bench using NIST traceable optical collimators and optical flats.  This alignment was initially carried out to 2 arc seconds. In addition to the optical bench  calibration, the LIDAR system was operated against a series of known targets to determine both scale factor and bias accuracy. All system timing was derived from GPS. For aircraft installation the critical factor was location of the GPS antenna with respect to the DATIS optical reference. This was accomplished through a differential GPS survey.

After installation in the aircraft, the system was then flown against a ground test range that was developed using differential GPS points from both static survey and a drive survey.  This range provides several thousand points that were used to statistically verify the in flight calibration. Highest grade GPS equiptment was used to help ensure the horizontal accuracy. When flight conditions were acceptable and the predicted GPS PDOP (Position Dilution of Precision) factor was below 3.0 (with at least 5 GPS satellites and 6 desired) for the duration of the planned flight mission, the data acquisition mission was undertaken.

The criteria for suitable flight conditions are clear visibility up to 2,000 m (6,560 ft. AGL (Above Ground Level)), calm to relatively low and steady wind speed with no icing conditions.  Prior to takeoff the DATIS system IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) was initialized on the ground for about 15 minutes. The plane (Cessna 206) then took off from Lawrence Municipal Airport, climbed to an altitude of 2,000 m and ferried to the project site. The DATIS system recorded data from the duration of the entire four hour mission and all laser, IMU, and GPS data were recorded onto 8mm tape cartridge.  The field crew extracted all flight data from tape, downloaded the GPS receivers, post processed the GPS data, pre-processed the LIDAR data, and screened the collected flight data. This procedure was used to determine whether any area needed to be reflown the following day due to data gaps between flight lines or low quality GPS data.  After all flight lines had been quality checked, the data was backed up onto 8mm cartridge tape and sent to 3Di's office in Boulder, Colorado, for post-processing and product generation.</horizpar>

      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>Calibration of the system was verified each time two or more flight lines were combined. This was a result of taking measurements on a common point from multiple locations (i.e. the ground point is fixed and each flight line that sees this is a different instrument location).  The calibration of the system was validated in terms of range and angular accuracies.  Our standard practice requires that at least one flight line within the project be flown in both directions for calibration verification of range and angular accuracy.

Another important area of quality control was edge matching.  All edge matching discrepancies in LIDAR DEM data occur between two flight lines.  The cause of this problem was nearly always associated with GPS data. Identification of edge matching discrepancies was performed by overlaying either the contour or the shaded relief model representation of the original DEMs.  If edge artifacts were found in the overlap area between two flight lines, the GPS data was reevaluated to check for any possible errors in the post processing or a spike in the PDOP at the time of data acquisition.  Usually this type of problem was resolved by reprocessing the GPS data or in the worst case, reacquiring the data.

For additional accuracy verification, static survey points were collected, using static benchmarks where available. Thirty-four survey points within the project boundary were selected to allow a statistical absolute elevation verification of the data.  This data set was then statistically compared to the project LIDAR DEM data after the combination of flight lines to verify accuracy both horizontal and vertical. The RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of the LIDAR DEM was calculated using the ground GPS data to ensure that the vertical error was less than 0.15 m.</vertaccr>

        <procdesc>The first step in the lidar data processing was to produce the x, y, z elevation points data using 3Di's proprietary lidar data processing software.  Within this integrated process an atmospheric correction was made, which was especially important in regions of relatively low elevation.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The next step in the laser data processing was to combine the flight lines in a merge process that eliminates any redundant points.  In this step the data was also clipped into more manageable one kilometer by one kilometer grids. Noise or anomalous returns were filtered from all data during this processing.  The data was quality checked using commercial software, Spectra Precision TerraModel and TerraVista.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The next step in the post-processing of the DEM data was to perform the ellipsoid to orthometric height conversion using the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) Geoid Model, GEOID99.  All elevation data was processed in this way on a point by point basis.  Datum and coordinate system conversion from WGS84 to the Massachusetts Mainland State Plane coordinate system was undertaken by using the US Army Corps of Engineers standard algorithm CorpsCon.</procdesc>
