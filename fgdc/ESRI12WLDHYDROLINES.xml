        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by Esri: Extracted the data set from the subset of DeLorme World Base Map (DWBM). Added field TYPE and calculated its values using the source DFCC code and descriptive look up table. Deleted all fields except NAME and TYPE. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>This layer was downloaded from the Esri Data and Maps 10.1 DVD.  The layer was originally stored in an SDC (Smart Data Compression) format.  ArcCatalog 10.1 was utilized to export the SDC file into an ArcSDE 9.3.1 database using the "Feature Class to Feature Class" export tool.</procdesc>
