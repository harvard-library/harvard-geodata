      <procstep>
        <procdesc>This data set was created from several sources and finalized.  Most features are based on a generalized version of the ArcWorld 1:3M coverage.  The country and administrative unit boundaries were utilized for most of the zone boundaries.  In a few instances, the ArcUSA 1:2M county level data for the United States and the ArcAtlas? data for some zone boundaries in Russia were used.  Most of the zones in ocean areas followed lines of longitude and latitude and were mathematically generated.  The values of plus and minus hours from Greenwich are from a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) map and the Rand McNally New International Atlas.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by Esri for Data &amp; Maps 2002: Extracted the finalized data set.  Updated areas in Canada including Nunavut.  Densified arcs at 0.1 decimal degrees to maintain curvature of longitude lines when projecting.  Generalized arcs at .02 decimal degrees.  Created regions based on the Zone attribute.  Output the data set as a shapefile.  Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>This layer was downloaded from the Esri Data and Maps 10.1 DVD.  The layer was originally stored in an SDC (Smart Data Compression) format.  ArcCatalog 10.1 was utilized to export the SDC file into an ArcSDE 9.3.1 database using the "Feature Class to Feature Class" export tool.</procdesc>
