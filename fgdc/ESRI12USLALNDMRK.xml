    <logic>The shapefile is converted to SDC (Smart Data Compression) format using tools in ArcGIS.  The SDC data set is then imported into a file geodatabase to verify, validate, and if needed repair the geometry.</logic>
    <complete>After processing, the data set is checked for drawing display and number of records and file sizes compared with source materials.</complete>

        <horizpar>Horizontal positional accuracy is dependent on geographic area. In most areas, accuracy is between 5 and 25 meters (16 and 82 feet). In some areas, accuracy is off by up to several tens of meters (100 feet or more). In the poorest areas, accuracy is off by up to 100 meters (328 feet).</horizpar>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by Esri: Extracted the Land Use data set from TomTom MultiNet North America v. 2011.09. Selected features whose centroid intersected Data &amp; Maps 10 U.S. Counties to get the U.S. features only. Selected the large area landmark features. Removed all fields except FEATTYP and NAME. Added field FCC and calculated its values based on MultiNet FEATTYP equivalents. Added field FEATTYPE and copied its values from MultiNet FEATTYP descriptions. Renamed field FEATTYP to MNFC. Added field SQMI and calculated its values. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>This layer was downloaded from the Esri Data and Maps 10.1 DVD.  The layer was originally stored in an SDC (Smart Data Compression) format.  ArcCatalog 10.1 was utilized to export the SDC file into an ArcSDE 9.3.1 database using the "Feature Class to Feature Class" export tool.</procdesc>
