        <procdesc>Urban polygons from the Digital Chart of the World (DCW) CD-ROM were extracted and converted to Arc/INFO format. Where the urban boundaries extended beyond the shoreline of State Boundaries of the United States, the shoreline was matched to the State Boundaries of the United States shoreline. Names of the urban areas were added using names in Cities and Towns of the United States (1998). In large metropolitan areas many smaller areas were labeled as part of the metropolitan area. The State in which the urban area is located was also added. Several areas were modified to conform to the 1:2,000,000-scale hydrography (Hydrography Features of the United States) layer. Some smaller polygons that represent undeveloped areas within the urban area were removed and merged with the larger urban area. Military reservations were also removed. Finally, the attribute for State FIPS was added.

The spellings for San Francisco, CA and Bismarck, ND were corrected.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded the ArcView GIS Shapefile compressed file, urbanap020.tar.gz, from http://www.nationalatlas.gov/atlasftp.html and extracted it. Added POPULATION attribute from ESRI Data &amp; Maps 2002 U.S. National Atlas Urbanized Areas and coded the values for the 44 records that did not find a match to -999. Corrected misspelled cities in the NAME attribute. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC.</procdesc>
