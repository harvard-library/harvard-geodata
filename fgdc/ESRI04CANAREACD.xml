        <procdesc>The data set is a fully georeferenced, purely digital product. The boundaries are based on CanMap municipalities. Source data ranges from municipal mapping at a very large scale of 1:2,000 or larger, to a medium scale of 1:50,000 scale from NTDB*.  Source time period of content ranges from a few to several years (as in the case of NTDB*).
 
*NTDB is the National Topographic Data Base, developed and maintained by Natural Resources Canada.</procdesc>

Removed erroneous sliver polygons in the ocean. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>This layer was originally downloaded from the ESRI Data and Maps 2004 DVD.  The file was stored in an SDC (Smart Data Compression) format on the DVD.  ArcCatalog 9.1 was utilized to export the SDC file to a shapefile, and then the "Repair Geometry" tool was used to correct geometric discrepancies that would otherwise have prevented a given line or polygon from being imported to Arc SDE.  After the "Repair Geometry" tool was run, the file was exported from ArcCatalog 9.1 to an ArcSDE 9.1 database, using the "Feature Class to Feature Class" export tool.</procdesc>
