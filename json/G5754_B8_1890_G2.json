  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Plan of Bristol, drawn, engraved by G.W. Bacon & Co. New and rev. ed. It was published by James Fawn & Son, ca. 1890. Scale 1:10,560. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the 'British National Grid' coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads and stations, street railway lines, drainage, built-up areas and selected buildings, cemeteries, parks, and more. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
