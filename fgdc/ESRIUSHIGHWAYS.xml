        <procdesc>The general processing steps for the creation of the National Highway Planning Network: - Conflation of attributes for rural highways from [National Highway Planning Network V1.1, Bruce Peterson, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 1992] to [USGS Digital Line Graph (DLG-3, 1978) Series] road alignments using R-MATCH software developed by the Geographic Information Systems Group, University of Tennessee. - Digitizing and conversion of state supplied digital and map data. Line work geodetically controlled to match [USGS Digital Line Graph (DLG-3, 1978) Series] line work. -Integration of conflated version of [National Highway Planning Network V1.1, Bruce Peterson, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 1992] and assimilated State Data into a comprehensive topologically integrated network database. States edgematched. -Integration of supplemental State Data into the National Highway Planning Network Version 2.

Recalculated any attributes based on length. Renamed the data set from roads.shp to highways.shp. Created ArcGIS(tm) layer file (.lyr).  Created ArcView legend file (.avl).  Created projection file (.prj).  Ran ArcView Avenue request ExportClean, and created spatial indices.</procdesc>
