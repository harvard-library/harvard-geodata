        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was calculated from latitude/longitude coordinates. The positional accuracy is unknown.

Note that some locations are the center point of broad volcanic fields, and that even at individual volcanoes the coordinates given do not necessarily match the eruption site. Tens of kilometers may separate eruptive centers of a single volcano, particularly in large caldera complexes and rift settings.</horizpar>

Deleted all features not in the United States. Renamed attributes ELEV to ELEVATION and TIMEFRAME to TIME_CODE. Added attributes KNOWN_ERUP and MAX_VEI from 2004 U.S. National Atlas Volcanoes. The two new records that did not find a match received "-999" for attributes KNOWN_ERUP and MAX_VEI. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
