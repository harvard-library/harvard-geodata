        <procdesc>[Date: 1998] Data from the National Transportation Atlas Databases 1997 (NTAD97) CD-ROM were obtained from the Department of Transportation.  Using the airport.pnt and airport.t01 files on the CD-ROM, airports with passenger enplanement of greater than or equal to 250 passengers per year were selected to create a point coverage to which the following attributes were attached: airport location identifier, name of airport, name of State, State FIPS code, Air Carrier Activity Information System airports, and Total Enplanement. The data were converted to shapefile format for use in National Atlas applications and for distribution to the public.

[Date: 19990216] Airports for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were added.  Airport names were changed from all upper case and no period after initials to lower case and period after initials.  For example, LYNDON B JOHNSON is now Lyndon B. Johnson.</procdesc>
