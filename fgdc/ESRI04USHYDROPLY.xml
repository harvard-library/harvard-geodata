        <procdesc>This file was originally digitized by the National Mapping Division based on the sectional maps contained in 'The National Atlas of the United States of America' published by the USGS in 1970.  The 1:2,000,000-scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) data were merged into a single national hydrography coverage. Where necessary to effect the merge, alignment changes were made.  The names were taken from the USGS Topographic 1:100,000-scale maps.  For Alaska, the names were taken from the USGS Topographic 1:250,000-scale maps.  State lines across water bodies were removed from the national coverage.  State attributes were assigned to the features.

Some spatial features were added and corrected.  Some name attributes were added or corrected.  All occurrences of St. were changed to Saint.  Extra spaces were removed from the attributes.  Hydrographic features for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were added. A minor adjustment was made to the shoreline in Galveston Bay, Texas.</procdesc>

Removed unneeded attributes.  Removed null records.  Reduced the width of attributes.  Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr).  Created projection file (.prj).  Ran ArcView GIS Avenue request ExportClean, and created spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Converted Hawaii to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) by splitting it from the rest of the United States; converting it to NAD83; then merging them together. Extended the Great Lakes to include the Canadian side by merging northern shores from Canada Water Bodies. Removed all ocean features, leaving only inland water (deleted Shoreline and Closure Lines). Added SQMI attribute and calculated its values.</procdesc>
