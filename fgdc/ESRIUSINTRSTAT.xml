      <abstract>U.S. National Transportation Atlas Interstate Highways represents rural and urban interstate highways. U.S. National Transportation Atlas Interstate Highways is part of the National Highway Planning Network version 2.1 published by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics as part of the National Transportation Atlas Databases for the United States.</abstract>
      <purpose>U.S. National Transportation Atlas Interstate Highways provides a comprehensive database of interstate highways from the nation's principal arterial highway system and the National Highway System.  The data is generalized to improve draw performance and be used effectively at a national level.</purpose>

        <procdesc>The general processing steps for the creation of the National Highway Planning Network: - Conflation of attributes for rural highways from [National Highway Planning Network V1.1, Bruce Peterson, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 1992] to [USGS Digital Line Graph (DLG-3, 1978) Series] road alignments using R-MATCH software developed by the Geographic Information Systems Group, University of Tennessee. - Digitizing and conversion of state supplied digital and map data. Line work geodetically controlled to match [USGS Digital Line Graph (DLG-3, 1978) Series] line work. -Integration of conflated version of [National Highway Planning Network V1.1, Bruce Peterson, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 1992] and assimilated State Data into a comprehensive topologically integrated network database. States edge matched. -Integration of supplemental State Data into the National Highway Planning Network Version 2.

Removed unneeded attributes. Converted to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). Recalculated any attributes based on length. Created ArcGIS(tm) layer file (.lyr).  Created ArcView legend file (.avl).  Created projection file (.prj).  Ran ArcView Avenue request ExportClean, and created spatial indices.</procdesc>
