        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted the data set from Tele Atlas Dynamap/Transportation.  Added the attribute TEXTLENGTH and calculated its values to the length of the text in the NAME attribute.  Added the STCTYFIPS attribute and coded it by overlaying on U.S. Counties.  Converted the data set to SDC.  Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
