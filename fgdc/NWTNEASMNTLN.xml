      <abstract>This data layer shows the boundaries of city-owned easements, typically for water, sewer, or storm-drain pipes.  The easement lines are often relative to a property boundary and so may only show the non-property boundary line; this is an artifact of how the easements lines were created.</abstract>
      <purpose>This layer is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production, or to provide a basemap to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to real property and public utilities
More advanced user applications may focus on urban planning, public works, or utilities purposes (including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.</purpose>
      <supplinf>The City of Newton's Engineering Department maintains this data layer using a customized GIS editing application.  Lot lines removed when properties are merged are and new boundaries are digitized directly from sub-division plans filed with the city by developers or Coordinate Geometry (COGO) data entry is used when available.  Control points for the digitizing are property boundary junctions visible on both the parcel coverage and the sub-division plan.</supplinf>

    <logic>For layers containing line or polygon features, Newton's data layers are "topologically clean". This was verified with Arc/Info software version 7.x in 1998 and is an ongoing part of data maintenance for the relevant data layers.</logic>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>No systematic and quantitative review of property boundary accuracy has ever been conducted.  However, several qualitative observations based on experience using the data are possible.  The street right-of-way lines overlay the orthophoto base map very well, falling on or close to the apparent back-of-sidewalk visible on the photos.The edge-of-pavement data layer was compiled from aerial photography for Boston Edison to an absolute accuracy specification of +/- 2.5 feet.  Again, the right-of-way lines match up well in this comparison.  Less is known about the accuracy of the internal property boundaries.  Casual observations suggest they are sometimes as accurate as the right-of-way lines and sometimes much less.  Some observations of boundary line discrepancies relative to property boundary lines such as fences and hedges visible on the orthophotos indicate that internal property boundaries may be off by at least +/- 5 feet.</horizpar>

        <srccontr>Aerial photographs used to produce orthophotographs and a planimetric base map.  Property boundaries were traced onto the planimetric base map.  These property lines were then digitized using computer assisted drafting (CAD) software</srccontr>
      </srcinfo>
      <procstep>
        <procdesc>In 1979, Newton awarded a contract to Burger Associates from Ohio to develop new maps at a uniform scale.  Burger Associates took aerial photographs of the city and used them to produce orthophotographs and a planimetric base map.  The base map included topographic contours with a two-foot contour interval.  The new parcel maps were compiled by photo reducing or enlarging the existing maps (most of which were at 1:480 scale) to the 1:1000 compilation scale.  The maps were adjusted to fit features such as the apparent back-of-sidewalk on the planimetric base map, and then property boundaries were traced onto the planimetric base map.  These property lines were then digitized using computer assisted drafting (CAD) software.   Two map sets were delivered, one at 1:1000 (1" = 83.3') scale (a metric scale produced to satisfy the requirements of the state funding involved) and one at 1:480 scale (1" = 40').

In late 1991, Newton contracted with Applied Geographics, Inc. (Boston, MA) for development of an Arc/Info version of its property parcels.  This was accomplished by converting the 168 CAD files (one each per 1:1000 scale sheet) provided by Burger Associates to Arc/Info format.  Once the CAD files were converted to Arc/Info, additional processing included:

Closing parcels bordering the Charles River; they were not closed after the DXF to Arc conversion because the river boundary in the DXF file was stored as a dashed line.  A replacement line was digitized from the 1:1000 scale assessor map sheets.

Property boundaries in the DXF files usually did not create closed polygons; this was corrected through a combination of automated procedures and interactive editing.
Boundaries crossing CAD file limits had to be edge-matched
In many instances rounded parcel corners collapsed (becoming straight or jagged) when the DXF files were converted to Arc format.  Many, but not all of these were corrected.  Some additional work has been completed on this, but the problem persists. A polygon label point was created for each parcel and the correct section/block/lot identifier added. The property splits and mergers from 1979 to April 1992 were incorporated.

This is a very complete record of property boundaries as it has been the focus of a lot of checking and other work that has reduced errors.  Remaining problems involve tiny sliver parcels at the edge of the city, which may or may not be real.  More work checking these situations needs to be performed.  In addition, there are instances of cul-de-sacs where the properties on each side at the end were not actually separate topologically because of a tiny sliver between the end of the cul-de-sac and the property line against which it terminates.  This issue is further complicated because some of these situations correctly depict the property shape. These problems notwithstanding, this data layer records over 99.9% of all properties in the city.</procdesc>
