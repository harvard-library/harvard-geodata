In some areas, accuracy is off by up to several tens of meters (100 feet or more). In the poorest areas, accuracy is off by up to 100 meters (328 feet).</horizpar>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted the Land Use data sets from Tele Atlas MultiNet North America v. 2010.03 and merged them into a nationwide data set. Selected the park features. Added field FEATTYPE and derived its values from MultiNet descriptions. Renamed field FEATTYP to MNFC. Added field SQMI and calculated its values from FEATAREA. Removed all fields but NAME, FEATTYPE, MNFC, and SQMI. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
