        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI for Data &amp; Maps 2002: Updated Saudi Arabia - Yemen border. Updated attributes for East Timor, Yugoslavia, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen.  Generalized to a tolerance of 0.1 decimal degrees.  Recalculated attributes based on area.  Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr) and ArcView GIS legend file (.avl).  Copied projection file (.prj) and created spatial indices.

The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted the features from ESRI Data &amp; Maps 1999 data set-cntry98.shp.  Updated political boundaries and attributes for 2000 for Macau, Hong Kong, and East Timor. Extended political boundaries into the Caspian Sea and removed the shoreline. Generalized to a tolerance of 0.1 decimal degrees.  Removed many tiny islands while maintaining the number of countries. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr).  Created ArcView GIS legend file (.avl).  Created projection file (.prj).  Created spatial indices.</procdesc>
