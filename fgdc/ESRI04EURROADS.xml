Recalculated LENGTH attribute. Added the CNTRYNAME attribute from Europe Countries. Rearranged and renamed attributes. Changed Yugoslavia to Serbia and Montenegro. Removed Virtual Connection features. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC.</procdesc>
