  "dc_description_s": "This polygon data layer represents the 2010 TIGER/Line Census subminor civil divisions for the U.S. Virgin Islands. The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. For the 2010 Census, subMCDs only exist in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico the subMCDs are termed subbarrios and are legally defined subdivisions of the minor civil division (MCD) named barrios-pueblo and barrios. In the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) the subMCDs are termed estates. The estates have legally defined boundaries and are much smaller is area than the Census Subdistricts, the USVI county subdivisions. The estates do not neatly subdivide the Census Subdistricts although they also have legally defined boundaries. In addition, the USVI has three towns with legally defined boundaries, incorporated places in the Census Bureau's geographic hierarchy, as well as numerous census designated places, all of which are very meaningful to data users, so the estates would only fit as subMCDs in the Census Bureau's geographic hierarchy for the 2010 Census. The boundaries of the subbarrios and estates are as of January 1, 2010 and were provided to the Census Bureau by the Puerto Rico Planning Board and the USVI Office of the Lieutenant Governor, respectively.",
