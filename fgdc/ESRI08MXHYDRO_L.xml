        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded data set from the Sistemas de Informacion Geografica, S.A. de C.V. FTP site. Removed coastlines and water polygon boundaries, and several tiny sliver polygons. Clipped the features at the international border. Corrected miscoded features. Added attributes NAME, TYPE, STATUS, and RANK. Translated the Spanish values in the source OBJETO attribute to English and put them into the TYPE and STATUS attributes. Populated the NAME attribute with the title case version of the values of the source NOMBRE attribute and changed "SIN NOMBRE" to blank. Added the KILOMETERS attribute and calculated its values. Coded the RANK attribute from RANK in 2006 Mexico Rivers and Streams using the Near geoprocessing tool. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
