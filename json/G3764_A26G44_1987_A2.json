  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Zoning map of the town of Acton, Massachusetts, map prepared for the Planning Board by the Engineering Department. It was published by the Engineering Department in 1987. Scale ca. 1:14,500. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Massachusetts State Plane Coordinate System, Mainland Zone (in Feet) (Fipszone 2001). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as roads, railroads, drainage, cities and other human settlements, territorial boundaries, shoreline features, and more.
