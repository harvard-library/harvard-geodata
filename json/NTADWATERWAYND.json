The data set covers the 48 contiguous States plus the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and water links between. Waterway Network Nodes may represent physical entities such as river confluences, ports/facilities, and intermodal terminals, US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE nodes), or may be inserted for analytical purposes. Approximately 224 USACE ports are geo-coded in the node database.",
