      <abstract>This datalayer is a polygon coverage representing First-Order Administrative Areas worldwide (as they existed in 2002) and was originally produced by ESRI for the Global GIS database.  Attribute data includes information on administrative region names, type, size (population) and country of location.

The USGS Global GIS database contains a wealth of USGS and other public domain data, including global coverages of elevation, landcover, seismicity, and resources of minerals and energy at a nominal scale of 1:1 million. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and The American Geological Institute (AGI) announced a cooperative agreement that will focus on making the USGS Global Geographic Information System (GIS) database readily available to educators and the general public in the form of a DVD based world atlas.</abstract>
      <purpose>World Administrative Areas provides a base map layer of first-order administrative areas for the world. 

This layer is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-economic and political analysis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning and related areas including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.</purpose>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI for Data &amp; Maps 2002: Updated Saudi Arabia - Yemen border. Updated attributes for East Timor, Yugoslavia, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. Recalculated attributes based on area. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr) and ArcView legend file (.avl). Copied projection file (.prj) and created spatial indices. 

The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted the features from ESRI Data &amp; Maps 1999 data set-admin98.shp. Updated political boundaries for countries and first-level administrative units. This included Nunavut in Canada and Macau in China as well as others. Extended political boundaries into the Caspian Sea and removed the shoreline. Created ArcGIST layer file (.lyr). Created ArcView legend file (.avl). Created projection file (.prj). Created spatial indices.</procdesc>
