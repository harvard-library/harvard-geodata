The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library. Area codes prior to May 1, 1998 are in the attribute table column labelled 'old.' Area Codes from May 1, 1998 to May 1, 2001 are contained in the column 'new.' Area codes for after May 1, 2001 are contained in the 'new2001' column. The area codes being established in 2001 are 'overlay' area codes. Multiple area codes will exist for each town.",
