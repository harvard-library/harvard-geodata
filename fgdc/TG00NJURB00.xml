      <abstract>This datalayer displays the Urbanized Areas (UAs) for the state based on a January 1, 2000 ground condition. Note that the Census Bureau made significant changes in Urban/Rural designations for the Census 2000 data layers.  Some of these delineations and definitions are explained below.

For Census 2000 the U.S. Census Bureau classifies as urban all territory, population, and housing units located within urbanized areas (UAs) and urban clusters (UCs). It delineates UA and UC boundaries to encompass densely settled territory, which generally consists of: 
- A cluster of one or more block groups or census blocks each of which has a population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile at the time
- Surrounding block groups and census blocks each of which has a population density of at least 500 people per square mile at the time, and
- Less densely settled blocks that form enclaves or indentations, or are used to connect discontiguous areas with qualifying densities.

Rural consists of all territory, population, and housing units located outside of UAs and UCs. For Census 2000 this urban and rural classification applies to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands of the United States.

Urbanized Areas (UAs)
An urbanized area consists of densely settled territory that contains 50,000 or more people. The U.S. Census Bureau delineates UAs to provide a better separation of urban and rural territory, population, and housing in the vicinity of large places. For Census 2000, the UA criteria were extensively revised and the delineations were performed using a zero-based approach. Because of more stringent density requirements, some territory that was classified as urbanized for the 1990 census has been reclassified as rural. (Area that was part of a 1990 UA has not been automatically grandfathered into the 2000 UA.) In addition, some areas that were identified as UAs for the 1990 census have been reclassified as urban clusters.

Urban Clusters (UCs)
An urban cluster consists of densely settled territory that has at least 2,500 people but fewer than 50,000 people. The U.S. Census Bureau introduced the UC for Census 2000 to provide a more consistent and accurate measure of the population concentration in and around places. UCs are defined using the same criteria that are used to define UAs. UCs replace the provision in the 1990 and previous censuses that defined as urban only those places with 2,500 or more people located outside of urbanized areas.

Urban Area Title and Code
The title of each UA and UC may contain up to three incorporated place names, and will include the two-letter U.S. Postal Service abbreviation for each state into which the UA or UC extends. However, if the UA or UC does not contain an incorporated place, the urban area title will include the single name of a census designated place (CDP), minor civil division, or populated place recognized by the U.S. Geological Survey's Geographic Names Information System. Each UC and UA is assigned a 5-digit numeric code, based on a national alphabetical sequence of all urban area names. For the 1990 census, the U.S. Census Bureau assigned as four-digit UA code based on the metropolitan area codes. 

Urban Area Central Places
A central place functions as the dominant center of an urban area. The U.S. Census Bureau identifies one or more central places for each UA or UC that contains a place. Any incorporated place or census designated place (CDP) that is in the title of the urban area is a central place of that UA or UC. In addition, any other incorporated place or CDP that has an urban population of 50,000 or an urban
population of at least 2,500 people and is at least 2/3 the size of the largest place within the urban area also is a central place.

Extended Places
As a result of the UA and UC delineations, an incorporated place or census designated place (CDP) may be partially within and partially outside of a UA or UC. Any place that is split by a UA or UC is referred to as an extended place.

1990 Urban/Rural 
The U.S. Census Bureau defined urban for the 1990 census as consisting of all territory and population in urbanized areas (UAs) and in the urban portion of places with 2,500 or more people located outside of the UAs. The 1990 urban and rural classification applied to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.

1990 Urbanized Areas 
A 1990 urbanized area (UA) consisted of at least one central place and the adjacent densely settled surrounding territory that together had a minimum population of 50,000 people. The densely settled surrounding territory generally consisted of an area with continuous residential development and a general overall population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile.

1990 Extended Cities 
For the 1990 census, the U.S. Census Bureau distinguished the urban and rural population within incorporated places whose boundaries contained large, sparsely populated, or even unpopulated area. Under the 1990 criteria, an extended city had to contain either 25 percent of the total land area or at least 25 square miles with an overall population density lower than 100 people per square mile. Such pieces of territory had to cover at least 5 square miles. This low-density area was classified as rural and the other, more densely settled portion of the incorporated place was classified as urban. Unlike previous censuses where the U.S. Census Bureau defined extended cities only within UAs, for the 1990 census the U.S. Census Bureau applied the extended city criteria to qualifying incorporated places located outside UAs.

1990 Urbanized Area Codes 
Each 1990 UA was assigned a 4-digit numeric census code in alphabetical sequence on a nationwide basis based on the metropolitan area codes. Note that in Record Type C, the 1990 UA 4-digit numeric census code and Census 2000 UA 5-digit numeric census code share a 5-character field. Because of this, the 1990 4-digit UA code, in Record Type C only, appears with a trailing blank.</abstract>
      <purpose>This layer is intended for researchers, students, and policy makers for reference and mapping purposes, and may be used for basic applications such as viewing, querying, and map output production. This layer will provide a basemap for layers related to socio-political analysis, statistical enumeration and analysis, or to support graphical overlays and analysis with other spatial data. 
More advanced user applications may focus on demographics, urban and rural land use planning, socio-economic analysis and related areas (including defining boundaries, managing assets and facilities, integrating attribute databases with geographic features, spatial analysis, and presentation output.)</purpose>
      <supplinf>The UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files are extracts of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing) database.  The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based either on January 1, 2000 or January 1, 1990  legal boundaries. The Census TIGER database represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts.  However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole nation and its territories.
The UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries.  The boundary information in the TIGER/Line files are for statistical data collection and tabulation purposes only; their depiction and designation for statistical purposes does not constitute a determination of jurisdictional authority or rights of ownership or entitlement.  The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county.  There are 17 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps.  Other geographic information contained in the files includes attributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features, and area boundaries.  The UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line data dictionary contains a complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types.

The attribute accuracy of the TIGER/Line files is as precise as the source used during the creation or update of the Census TIGER database. Accuracy statements on the Census TIGER database are based on deductive estimates; no specific field tests for attribute accuracy have been conducted on the files. However, updates or corrections resulting from normal U.S. Census Bureau field operations are entered into the Census TIGER database. In addition, quality checks are conducted to verify clerical transcription of data from source materials. Based on past experience, attribute codes match the source materials with less than a two-percent error.
The feature network of complete chains (as represented by Record Types 1 and 2) is complete for census purposes. Data users should be aware that on occasion they might not be able to trace a specific feature by name or by census feature class code (CFCC) as a continuous line throughout the TIGER/Line files without making additional edits. For example, State Highway 32 may cross the entire county. The TIGER/Line files will contain complete chains in the file at the location of State Highway 32, but the complete chains may individually have one of a collection of local names such as S Elm Street, or Smallville Highway, with or without State Highway 32 as an alternate. The most frequent CFCC for a state highway is A21, but the complete chains at the location of State Highway 32 may have a variety of class codes such as A01, A41, or A21. Recent edits have reduced this problem, but not eliminated it.

Boundaries and Geographic Entity Codes
The U.S. Census Bureau collects and tabulates information for both legal and statistical entities. Record Type 1 mainly identifies the boundaries and codes for the legal entities reported to the U.S. Census Bureau to be legally in effect as of the Census 2000 Boundary and Annexation Survey. Record Types 3 and A generally contain the 1990 census tabulation geographic boundaries and codes for those entities. Most legal boundaries are based on the annotations made by local officials in response to the U.S. Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Surveys. The boundary information in the TIGER/Line files are for statistical data collection and tabulation purposes only; their depiction and designation for statistical purposes does not constitute a determination of jurisdictional authority or rights of ownership or entitlement. 

Local data users generally define and delineate statistical entities following U.S. Census Bureau guidelines. However, there are several exceptions:
- The U.S. Census Bureau defines Urbanized Areas (UAs) based strictly on technical considerations. USGS edited the FIPS 55 file to ensure alphabetical sorting and data consistency. As a result, changes were made to the FIPS 55 codes and related class codes. These changes, plus codes for new Census 2000 entities, appear in Record Type C. Other attribute data in the TIGER/Line files were gathered from many sources. The U.S. Census Bureau's staff linked the attribute information to the spatial framework of features. Most procedures for gathering the needed attributes were clerical. The quality of these attributes was ensured by various tests conducted before, during, and after the time that the attribute information was entered into the Census TIGER database. Tests included source material selection and evaluation checks, quality control checks on staff work, independent reviews by local and tribal leaders of maps produced from the Census TIGER database, and staff reviews of computer-performed operations.
- The U.S. Census Bureau defines ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) through an automated process utilizing addresses in the TIGER database and the Master Address File (MAF).
- State Departments of Education delineate school districts.
- The designated liaison for the Redistricting Data Program supplies Voting Districts (VTDs) and State Legislative Districts (SLDs).
- Metropolitan Planning Organizations or State Departments of Transportation define Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZs). The USGS maintains the file that is published as FIPS 55. The U.S. Census Bureau uses the file for coding American Indian/Alaska Native Areas, county subdivisions, consolidated cities, places, and sub-MCDs. 

Address Ranges and ZIP Codes
The conversion from the Geographic Base File/Dual Independent Map Encoding (GBF/DIME)-Files to the TIGER format involved neither verification of previously existing address ranges nor any significant updates or corrections. Prior to the release of the 1992 TIGER/Line files, the address ranges for an area were generally the same as those in the corresponding 1980 GBF/DIME-File. The 1992 TIGER/Line files included ACF address ranges for existing and new features identified during census operations. Address ranges and ZIP Codes were verified and coverage extended for Census 2000 through the use of the Master Address File (MAF). The MAF is closely linked to the Census TIGER database. Local address lists and addresses from the U.S. Postal Service supplement the MAF. Through an automated matching process, addresses in the MAF were compared to existing address ranges in the Census TIGER database creating or modifying the TIGER address ranges where necessary.

Feature Identifiers
A national consistency review of all feature names in the Census TIGER database was performed by running a revised name standardizing operation on all feature identifiers. An additional benefit was the removal of nonstandard characters and punctuation from the names. To improve accuracy, road names in the Census TIGER database were compared with street names in the ZIP+4 file from the US Postal Service. Errors in feature directionals or feature types were corrected in the Census TIGER database.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>Node-line-area relationships satisfy topological requirements. These requirements include the following:
- Complete chains must begin and end at nodes.
- Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes.
- Complete chains do not extend through nodes.
- Left and right polygons are defined for each complete chain element and are consistent for complete chains connecting at nodes.
- Complete chains representing the limits of a file are free from gaps. The U.S. Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical consistency and limits of file. Some polygons in the TIGER/Line files are so small that the polygon internal point has been manually placed on a node that defines the polygon perimeter. The U.S. Census Bureau uses it's internally developed Geographic Update System to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census TIGER database. The Census TIGER database has two generations of currency in geographic areas. These are the 1990 census areas and the Census 2000 areas. The location, type, and number of areas affect the boundaries of geographic areas.
To prepare for Census 2000, those features used only as boundaries in the 1980 census were deleted. The deletions lowered the overall count of complete chains and polygons. Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for states, counties, municipalities, and places, are used when encoding spatial entities. The U.S. Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original Census TIGER database files. Most of the codes themselves were provided to the U.S. Census Bureau by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the agency responsible for maintaining FIPS 55.</logic>
    <complete>Data completeness of the TIGER/Line files reflects the contents of the Census TIGER data base at the time the TIGER/Line files (UA 2000 version) were created.
The GBF/DIME-Files and the USGS's DLG were the two main sources of spatial attribute data. Data for a given category contain attribute codes that reflect the information portrayed on the original source. The TIGER/Line files also use the U.S. Census Bureau's internal coding scheme which in some cases parallels the FIPS codes. The feature network of complete chains is complete for census purposes. For the 1990 census and Census 2000, census enumerators identified new and previously unreported street features for the entire nation during a series of decennial census operations. In some areas, local officials reviewed the census maps and identified new features and feature changes. The TIGER/Line files contain limited point and area landmark data. The enumerator updates for decennial censuses do not stress landmark features. Computer file matching and automated updates from the Economic and Agriculture censuses added landmarks and key geographic locations (KGLs).</complete>

      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The U.S. Census Bureau's mission to count and profile the Nation's people and institutions does not require very high levels of positional accuracy in its geographic products. Its files and maps are designed to show only the relative positions of elements. Coordinates in the TIGER/Line files are in decimal degrees and have six implied decimal places. The positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as the six decimal places suggest. The positional accuracy varies with the source materials used, but at best meets the established National Map Accuracy standards (approximately + /- 167 feet) where 1:100,000-scale maps from the USGS are the source.
The U.S. Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of feature updates added by its field staff or of features derived from the GBF/DIME-Files or other map or digital sources. Thus, the level of positional accuracy in the TIGER/Line files is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface. Despite the fact that TIGER/Line data positional accuracy is not as high as the coordinate values imply, the six-decimal place precision is useful when producing maps. This precision allows you to place features that are next to each other on the ground in the correct position, relative to each other, on the map without overlap.</horizpar>

Software (TIGER DB routines) written by the Geography Division allows for efficient access to Census TIGER system data.  TIGER/Line files are extracted from the Census TIGER database by county or statistical equivalent area.  
Census TIGER data for a given county or statistical equivalent area is then distributed among 17 fixed length record ASCII files, each one containing attributes for either line, polygon, or landmark geographic data types.  The Census Bureau has released various versions of the TIGER/Line files since 1988, with each version having more updates (feature and feature names, address ranges and ZIP Codes, coordinate updates, revised field definitions, etc.) than the previous version.</procdesc>
