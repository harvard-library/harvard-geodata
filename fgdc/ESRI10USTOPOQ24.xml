      <abstract>U.S. USGS 1:24,000 Topographic Quadrangle Series Index represents the geographic extent of USGS 1:24,000 topographic maps (7.5- by 7.5-minute quadrangles) for the coterminous U.S. forty-eight states and District of Columbia.</abstract>
      <purpose>U.S. USGS 1:24,000 Topographic Quadrangle Series Index provides quadrangle name, identification number, publication data, and map coverage by state for each quadrangle. This large-scale index grid is appropriate for display at more detailed scales.</purpose>

    <logic>The shapefile is converted to SDC (Smart Data Compression) format using either tools in ArcGIS or ESRI SDC Data Development Kit Professional 2 (DDKP2).  The SDC data set is then imported into a file geodatabase to verify and validate the geometry. Occasionally, USGS actual quadrangles depart from a completely rectangular format mainly because of map sheet production considerations in coastal areas and offshore islands that result in offset, over edge, and inset sheet layouts. These are not represented precisely by the data set, but the correct attribute information is included.</logic>
    <complete>After processing, the data set is checked for drawing display and number of records and file sizes compared with source materials.</complete>

        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was mathematically generated using the ARC/INFO GRID? extension.  In this manner, the locations of the quadrangles were computed.  The positional accuracy for these quadrangles is limited only by the resolution of the data set which is 51 meters.</horizpar>

        <enttypd>The polygons represent a systematic grid of 7.5- by 7.5-minute quadrangles based on a latitude-longitude graticule for the coterminous U.S. forty-eight states and District of Columbia. Each 7.5- by 7.5-minute quadrangle is 1/32 the area of a USGS 1:100,000 topographic quadrangle and 1/128 of a USGS 1:250,000 topographic quadrangle.</enttypd>

        <attrdef>The quadrangle identification number. The first two digits represent the latitude in degrees north, the next three digits represent the longitude in degrees west, a hyphen, and the last two characters reveal the grid cell code within each one-degree rectangle. To understand the grid cell code within the one-degree rectangle, imagine a rectangle the shape of a door. Divide the "door" into eight rows (A-H) and columns (1-8), the lower right corner grid cell code is "A1" and the upper left corner grid cell code is "H8". Each grid cell represents a USGS 1:24,000 topographic quadrangle, hence sixty-four per one-degree rectangle. Each USGS 1:100,000 topographic quadrangle is one-half by one degree with only two fitting within the one-degree rectangle-the upper half and the lower half of the "door". The lower quadrangle's grid cell code is "A1" and the upper quadrangle's grid cell code is "E1" (these are the only grid cell codes for USGS 1:100,000 topographic quadrangles). Each USGS 1:250,000 topographic quadrangle is one by two degrees, which, is two "doors" side by side. The quadrangle's grid cell code is "A1" (this is the only grid cell code for USGS 1:250,000 topographic quadrangles).</attrdef>

The word "(digital)" in a quadrangle name also indicates that the quadrangle is theoretical. It is usually for quadrangles that show islands that are at a distance from the map sheets on which they are inset.</attrdef>
