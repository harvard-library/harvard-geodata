      <abstract>This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: This map of the county of Middlesex in the island of Jamaica; laid down from the papers, and under the direction of Henry Moore, Esqr., His Majesty's Lieutenant Governor and Commander in Chief of that island, in the years 1756, 57, 58, 60, &amp; 61 and from a great number of actual surveys performed by the publishers is humbly inscribed by his lordship's most obedient &amp; most humble servants, Thos. Craskell, engineer, Jas. Simpson, surveyor. It was published by D. Fournier in 1763. Scale [ca. 1:95,000]. The layer is image 3 of 4 total images of the four sheet map, representing the northwest portion of the map.  The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Jamaica Grid projected coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as towns, villages, and other human settlements, roads, parish boundaries, drainage, selected buildings and names of landowners, ground cover, shoreline features, shoals, channels, anchorage points, and more.  This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.</abstract>
      <purpose>Historic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred in the cultural and physical landscape.  The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change.  As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>The georeferenced raster is a faithfully reproduced digital image of the original source map. Some differences may be detected between the source graphic used and the raster image due to the RGB values assigned that particular color. The intent is to recreate those colors as near as possible.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <complete>Data completeness for raster digital image files reflect content of the source graphic. Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic due to scale and legibility constraints</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The horizontal positional accuracy of a raster image is approximately the same as the accuracy of the published source map.  The lack of a greater accuracy is largely the result of the inaccuracies with the original measurements and possible distortions in the original paper map document. There may also be errors introduced during the digitizing and georeferencing process. For instance, this raster image was georeferenced, in part, to another georeferenced image, which has its own positional inaccuracies (see "Process Steps"). In most cases, however, errors in the raster image are small compared with sources of error in the original map graphic.  The RMS error for this map is 318.89494 meters.  This value describes how consistent the transformation is between the different control points (links).  The RMS error is only an assessment of the accuracy of the transformation.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>Production of this raster image began with the scanning of the paper map on a high-resolution scanner: (Betterlight, Super8K2 scanning back camera and ViewFinder capture software). Maps were photographed at a copy stand. A vacuum easel and/or Plexiglas or points were used to secure loose maps. Foldouts and bound volumes were supported using cradles and built up foam core and matt board supports. The imaging specification was designed to produce detailed "Archival Master" images that, to the extent possible, are faithful reproductions of the originals, that capture the fine detail present in the originals, and that allow for detailed screen reproduction and print reproduction at up 1:1. Images were saved as lossless JPEG2000 files to reduce storage needs and to facilitate variable size viewing. Color and tonal corrections were made using Adobe Photoshop. Image files were viewed on a calibrated monitor. Editing was performed in an ISO 3664 compliant proofing environment.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Using ArcMap 9.3.1 software, the digital JPEG2000 image was georeferenced to common points located on digital vector shapefiles. For this image, the following vector shapefiles were used as a base map for reference: A Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Shoreline Database (National Geophysical Data Center, 1996) (1:100,000); and ESRI Data and Maps 2010:  World Administrative Units (1:15,000,000). In addition to the vector data listed above, this JPEG 2000 was also georeferenced to Sheet 4 of the same paper map set. The base map data is projected in the Jamaica Grid projected coordinate system, and the image was subsequently georeferenced to the same projection.A world file (.j2w) was automatically generated and saved in association with the digital image. See 'Horizontal Accuracy' for the RMS error of this image. Please note that the projection will need to be defined by the user in order to display the image with other projected data and the world file will need to be stored in the same root directory as the image.</procdesc>

    <overview>
      <eaover>The indexes reference a color palette of RGB values from 0 through 255, representing the color value from the original paper sheet map. The colors on that sheet can represent relief, drainage, vegetation, populated places, cultural features, coastal hydrography, transportation features (roads, railroads, tracks and trails), spot elevations and boundaries. The colors are sometimes explained in a legend that is incorporated into the map inset or collar.</eaover>
