  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic paper map entitled: Nova et accuratissima tabula regionum ad Sinum Finnicum : exactissime delineata ac sumneo studio recognito. It was published by: Henrico de Leth ca. 1740. Scale approximately 1:1,150,000. Map in Latin. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the WGS 1984 UTM Zone 35N (EPSG: 32635) coordinate system. All map features and collar and inset information are shown as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. Insets of eight cities included. This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features. The selection represents a range of geographies, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and map purposes.",
