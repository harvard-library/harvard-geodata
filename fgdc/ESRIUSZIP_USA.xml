      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was extracted from many sources.  Most locations are based on 1990 Census Version TIGER/Line(tm) files (CD-ROM edition), processed to improve their accuracy, then placed as points based on the actual distribution of residential deliveries within each ZIP code polygon.  Residential Post Office ZIP Codes (with RPO_flag R) are placed at the actual location of the post office.  Other ZIP Code points include Post Office box ZIP Codes and Unique ZIP Codes (single site, building or organization).  Due to the different sources and methods used, the horizontal accuracy is unknown.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>Most ZIP Code points are placed based on the actual distribution of residential deliveries within each ZIP Code area.  Delivery-based locations may be thought of as "residential delivery" weighted centroids.  When delivery information is unavailable for a particular ZIP Code area, the location will be placed based on the geographic center of the ZIP Code area.  Residential Post Office ZIP Codes (with RPO_flag R) are placed at the actual location of the post office.  If the actual location cannot be found, the centroid of the enclosing ZIP Code is used.  Other ZIP Code points include Post Office box ZIP Codes and Unique ZIP Codes (single site, building or organization).</procdesc>

Converted Hawaii to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83), then if present, merged Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and the 48 contiguous states (including District of Columbia).  Removed several unneeded attributes.  Copied Area attribute from U.S. ZIP Code Areas data set.  Created ArcGIS(tm) layer file (.lyr).  Created ArcView legend file (.avl).  Created projection file (.prj).  Ran ArcView Avenue request ExportClean, and created spatial indices.</procdesc>
