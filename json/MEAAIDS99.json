This dataset was originally published as part of the Massachusetts Electronic Atlas database in 2001. Statistics were derived from the Boston Public Health Commission's Communicable Disease Control department. The Massachusetts Electronic Atlas (MEA) was a collaborative project to provides access, via the Internet, to data about the Commonwealth, its thirteen regional planning agency districts and 351 cities and towns. This dataset is now only available via The Harvard Geospatial Library.",
