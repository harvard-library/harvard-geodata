Each county and statistically equivalent entity is assigned a three-digit Federal Information Processing Standards code that is unique within the state. These codes are assigned in alphabetical order of county or county equivalent within each state. The first-order divisions of Louisiana are parishes; Louisiana has no primary divisions, the entire area is considered equivalent to a county for data presentation purposes.",
