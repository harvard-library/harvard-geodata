        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted the data set (eur5_sr_r.shp) from AND Global Road Data. Removed all features where values of the LEVEL attribute are greater than 2. Removed all features but the ferries. Removed unneeded attributes and renamed others. Added the PAS_FLAG attribute from the RD_TONNAGE attribute. Added the CNTRYNAME attribute and coded it based on values from Europe Countries. Added the LENGTH attribute and calculated its values. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
