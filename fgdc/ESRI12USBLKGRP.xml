        <horizpar>Horizontal positional accuracy is dependent on geographic area. In most areas, accuracy is between 5 and 25 meters (16 and 82 feet). In some areas, accuracy is off by up to several tens of meters (100 feet or more). In the poorest areas, accuracy is off by up to 100 meters (328 feet).</horizpar>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by Esri: Extracted the block group data set from TomTom MultiNet North America Administrative Areas v. 2011.12. Clipped to the coastline with the Data &amp; Maps 10 U.S. States data set. Removed the U.S. Virgin Islands. Added dataset related FIPS fields and calculated their values from the MultiNet field CODE. Attached and formatted the fields from 2010 Census Summary File 1 and Esri Data. Renamed and reordered fields to best match the Data &amp; Maps 10 field names. Added field SQMI and calculated its values projected to Albers Equal Area. Recalculated POP00_SQMI and POP10_SQMI with new SQMI values. Put "-99" values into all number type fields (except SQMI) for records where there were no matches. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>

        <enttypd>The polygons represent the U.S. Census block groups within the United States. A block group is a combination of census blocks that is a subdivision of a census tract, and is generally defined to contain between 600 and 3,000 people. A block group consists of all blocks whose numbers begin with the same digit in a given census tract. For the 2010 Census, a block group value of 0 for the water portion can be delineated in any census tract and not just those census tracts also defined to only include water area.</enttypd>
