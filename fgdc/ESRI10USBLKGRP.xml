        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted the block group data set from Tele Atlas MultiNet Administrative Areas v. 2010.03. Clipped the coastline with the Tele Atlas MultiNet North America water data set. Removed the U.S. Virgin Islands. Added field FIPS and calculated its values from the MultiNet field CODE. Attached and formatted the fields from 2009 Data Update U.S. Census Block Groups. Replaced field POP2009 with POP2010 and field POP09_SQMI with POP10_SQMI. Put "-99" values into all number type fields (except SQMI) for records where there were no matches. Calculated new values for fields POP00_SQMI, POP10_SQMI, and SQMI from the MultiNet field FEATAREA. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>

        <enttypd>The polygons represent the U.S. Census block groups within the United States. A block group is a combination of census blocks that is a subdivision of a census tract. A block group consists of all blocks whose numbers begin with the same digit in a given census tract. The block group is the lowest level of geography for which the Census Bureau has tabulated sample data in the 2000 census.</enttypd>
