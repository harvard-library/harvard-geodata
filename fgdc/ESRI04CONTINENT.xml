Updated political boundaries for countries and first-level administrative units.  Used Continent attribute to dissolve out the necessary features to create the continents. Removed unnecessary attributes. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr).  Created projection file (.prj).  Created spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC.</procdesc>
