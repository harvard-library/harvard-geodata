      <abstract>U.S. State Plane Zones (NAD 1983) represents the State Plane Coordinate System (SPCS) Zones for the 1983 North American Datum within United States.</abstract>
      <purpose>U.S. State Plane Zones (NAD 1983) is generalized and an approximation of the actual State Plane Coordinate System zone boundaries for the 1983 North American Datum.  It is intended for visual reference at small and medium map scales.  Please check with state authorities if you have a question about a zone boundary.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Largest scale when displaying the data: 1:5,000,000.  Several State Plane Coordinate System zones are not shown in this data set, including Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and Louisiana's offshore zone.</supplinf>

        <procdesc>This data set was created from several sources: Extracted state boundaries from ArcUSA 1:25M.  Created state plane boundaries based the map, "Index of State Plane Coordinate (SPC) Zone Codes (NAD 1983)" dated 12/1988 and published by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  How NAD 1983 changed from NAD 1927: - CA_7 (Los Angeles County) was combined with CA_5.  - Michigan changed its zones, MI_W, MI_C, and MI_E that use the Transverse Mercator projection, to MI_N, MI_C, and MI_S that use the Lambert Conformal Conic projection. SPCS1927 shows the old zones even though they aren't strictly NAD 1927.  - The three Montana zones were combined into one.  - The two Nebraska zones were combined into one.  - The two South Carolina zones were combined into one.  - Valencia County in New Mexico is in NM_W for NAD 1927, but in NM_C for NAD 1983.  - Part of Grant County in Washington was changed from WA_S to WA_N.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded the ArcView Shapefile, spcs_zone.zip, from http://www.esri.com/data/online/esri/datapacks/stateplane.html and extracted it.  Removed unneeded attributes.  Converted to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) by splitting the United States into Alaska, Hawaii, and the 48 contiguous states (including District of Columbia); converting each to NAD83; then merging them together.  Created ArcGIS(tm) layer file (.lyr).  Created ArcView legend file (.avl).  Created projection file (.prj).  Ran ArcView Avenue request ExportClean, and created spatial indices.</procdesc>
