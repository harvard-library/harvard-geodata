        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted Eur_c.shp from AND Global Road Data. Removed unneeded attributes. Added the TYPE attribute and coded it with the type descriptions. Recoded the TYPE attribute for some features based on comparisons with Europe Cities. Added CNTRYNAME attribute and coded it based on the values of the NATION attribute. Merged multiple record features into single record features. Rearranged and renamed attributes. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC.</procdesc>
