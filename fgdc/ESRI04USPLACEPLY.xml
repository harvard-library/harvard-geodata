      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was extracted from the 2000 Census TIGER/Line files. The information present in these files is provided for the purposes of statistical analysis and census operations only.  Coordinates in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as the six decimal places suggest.  The positional accuracy varies with the source materials used, but generally the information is no better than the established national map Accuracy standards for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.  The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum, 1983.  For the contiguous 48 States, the cartographic fidelity of most of the Census 2000 TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the 1980 census Geographic Base File/Dual Independent map Encoding (GBF/DIME) file coverage and selected other large metropolitan areas, compare favorably with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps.  The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of features inside of what was the 1980 GBF/DIME-File coverage or selected metropolitan areas.  The Census Bureau added updates to the TIGER/Line files that enumerators annotated on maps sheets prepared from the Census TIGER data base as they attempted to traverse every street feature shown on the Census 2000 map sheets; the Census Bureau also made other corrections from updated map sheets supplied by local participants for Census Bureau programs.  The locational accuracy of these updates is of unknown quality.  In addition to the Federal, State, and local sources, portions of the files may contain information obtained in part from maps and other materials prepared by private companies.  Despite the fact the TIGER/Line data positional accuracy is not as high as the coordinate values imply, the six-decimal place precision is useful when producing maps.  The precision allows features that are next to each other on the ground to be placed in the correct position, on the map, relative to each other, without overlap.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>Place Boundary and Place Inventory Files contain the geographic data required to depict maps of Census Place (or community) boundary lines for the United States. They are available only by State. The data included in these boundary files was extracted from the 2000 Census TIGER/Line files. The county, tract, block group, and place files have been edited together. This means that where appropriate, they nest on top of one another. For example, a segment of a tract boundary that happens to be along a county border will match exactly with the corresponding county boundary segment.</procdesc>

Removed Puerto Rico features and dissolved out the county boundaries based on the state fips/place code values. Added two Alaska features from the Census Bureau Cartographic Boundary Files. Converted Hawaii to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). Joined identical attributes (Census SF1) from Data &amp; Maps 2002 U.S. Populated Place Polygons.  Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>This layer was originally downloaded from the ESRI Data and Maps 2004 DVD.  The file was stored in SDC (Smart Data Compression) format on the DVD.  ArcCatalog 9.1was utilized to export the SDC file to a shapefile and then loaded into an ArcSDE 9.1 database using the command line importing tool "SHP2SDE".   Any shapes that were rejected due to bad geometry were fixed with the "Repair Geometry" tool in ArcCatalog.  These shapes were then appended to the ArcSDE layer using the SDE command line tool "SHP2SDE append".</procdesc>
