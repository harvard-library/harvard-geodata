    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was extracted from the 1990 Census Version TIGER/Line(tm) files (CD-ROM edition). To improve the accuracy, GDT ran a process against the entire nationwide database. The positional accuracy of this data set exceeds the positional accuracy of the TIGER/Line coordinates.  The positional accuracy of the TIGER/Line coordinates varies with the source materials used but at best meets the established National Map Accuracy standards (+/- 167 feet approximately) where 1:100,000-scale maps from the USGS are the source. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of feature updates added by its field staff or of features derived from the GBF/DIME-Files or other map sources. Thus, the level of positional accuracy in the TIGER/Line files is not suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>GDT maintains Highways data from its internal, master database that includes nationwide street and road network data and 1990 Census data. Technicians then begin a state-by-state editing process that includes (but is not limited to): Eliminating errant segments-Occasionally, we have discovered cases where the highway, as digitized, deviates considerably from the actual course. In these cases, GDT technicians digitize the correct segments and delete the erroneous ones.  Feature reclassification-Another drawback to TIGER-derived files was their feature classification codes (FCCs). These codes were an attempt to classify streets and roads based on maintenance, a procedure that varied dramatically in different geographic areas. To correct this problem and create a consistent nationwide highway system, GDT reclassified almost every street and road in the nation based on its use.  Highways names are applied according to a layered hierarchy. Where a highway segment has more than one name, the higher-level name will always be used, and always in this order: Interstates, then U.S. Highways, State Highways and Local Names.  The data GDT uses to define highways and ensure completeness is culled from the following sources: ? Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways. Published by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration. Lists all interstates. ? U.S. Numbered Highways. Published by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officers. Lists all state and U.S. highways. ? State highway maps. Highway maps from state travel and tourism agencies and/or state departments of transportation.</procdesc>
