      <abstract>U.S. ZIP Code Points represents the five-digit U.S. ZIP Code areas as points by placing their location using delivery-based centroids, plus all ZIP Codes that have no area and are represented as points rather than areas such as post office box ZIP Codes and unique ZIP Codes (single site, building, or organization).</abstract>
      <purpose>U.S. ZIP Code Points provides the post office name, types, and area for each ZIP Code location in the United States.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Largest scale when displaying the data: 1:100,000.</supplinf>

        <procdesc>Delivery-Based Centroids
Oftentimes the distribution of postal deliveries is not evenly spread across a 5-digit ZIP code area, but is concentrated in one corner of the polygon. Delivery-based centroids were developed to express the actual distribution of deliveries within a ZIP code polygon. Delivery-based centroids may be thought of as a "delivery" weighted centroid. When delivery information is unavailable for particular ZIP code polygon, the Tele Atlas Delivery-based centroid will show the geographic centroid.

Point ZIP Codes
There are many 5-digit ZIP Codes that have no area and are represented as points rather than polygons. These ZIP Codes appear as dots on a map with no area and, therefore, no boundaries. These ZIP Codes have no geographic extent defined in terms of street segments, or that correspond to geography not defined in any Postal Service data files. Examples of point ZIP Codes include Post Office box ZIP Codes, RPOs and Unique ZIP Codes (single site, building or organization).</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted data set from Tele Atlas Dynamap/Census Boundaries v. 7.0.  Removed unnecessary attributes and reformatted the rest.  Added attributes POP2005, POP05_SQMI, and SQMI by joining to 2006 U.S. ZIP Code Areas (Five-Digit) and calculated their values to "-99" where there were no matches.  In cases where there are two points for a ZIP Code because it falls in two states, calculated their values to "-99" in attributes POP2005, POP05_SQMI, and SQMI for the point in the state with the smallest area.  Converted the data set to SDC.  Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
