      <abstract>This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic blueprint map entitled: Northeast Pass, Makemo Island, Paumotu group, from a sextant reconnaissance by the officers of U.S.F.C Stmr. Albatross, Comdr. Jeff'n F. Moser, U.S.N. Comd'g ; triangulation and topography by Lieut. Hugh Rodman, U.S.N. ; magnetic observations by Ensign A.J. Hepburn, U.S.N., hydrography by Lieut. Rodman and Ensign C.S. Kempff, U.S.N. It was published by the United States Fish Commissioner in 1899. Scale 1:5,000. Covers the village of Pouheva and the North East Pass, Atoll Makemo, Archipel des Tuamotu, French Polynesia.The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) coordinate system. All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This map shows features such as drainage, human settlements, roads, buildings, boat landings, ground cover, shoreline features, bays, islands and islets, harbors, inlets, points, rocks, and more. Depths shown by soundings. Includes tide information.This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from the Harvard Map Collection and the Harvard University Library as part of the Open Collections Program at Harvard University project: Organizing Our World: Sponsored Exploration and Scientific Discovery in the Modern Age. Maps selected for the project correspond to various expeditions and represent a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.</abstract>
      <purpose>Historic paper maps can provide an excellent view of the changes that have occurred in the cultural and physical landscape.  The wide range of information provided on these maps make them useful in the study of historic geography, and urban and rural land use change.  As this map has been georeferenced, it can be used in a GIS as a source or background layer in conjunction with other GIS data.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>The georeferenced raster is a faithfully reproduced digital image of the original source map. Some differences may be detected between the source graphic used and the raster image due to the RGB values assigned that particular color. The intent is to recreate those colors as near as possible.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <complete>Data completeness for raster digital image files reflect content of the source graphic. Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic due to scale and legibility constraints</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The horizontal positional accuracy of a raster image is approximately the same as the accuracy of the published source map.  The lack of a greater accuracy is largely the result of the inaccuracies with the original measurements and possible distortions in the original paper map document.  There may also be errors introduced during the digitizing and georeferencing process.  In most cases, however, errors in the raster image are small compared with sources of error in the original map graphic.  The RMS error for this map is 0.000228362 decimal degrees.  This value describes how consistent the transformation is between the different control points (links).  The RMS error is only an assessment of the accuracy of the transformation.</horizpar>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Production of this raster image began with the scanning of the paper map on a high-resolution scanner: (Betterlight, Super8K2 scanning back camera and ViewFinder capture software). Loose and bound maps for the OCP Exploration project were photographed at a copy stand. A vacuum easel and/or Plexiglas or points were used to secure loose maps. Foldouts and bound volumes were supported using cradles and built up foam core and matt board supports. The imaging specification was designed to produce detailed "Archival Master" images that, to the extent possible, are faithful reproductions of the originals, that capture the fine detail present in the originals, and that allow for detailed screen reproduction and print reproduction at up 1:1. Images were saved as lossless JPEG2000 files to reduce storage needs and to facilitate variable size viewing. For proofing purposes, original materials were evaluated using GTI EVS viewing booths. Images were evaluated using calibrated Eizo ColorEdge monitors. Tonal and color corrections were made using Adobe Photoshop. Master Image files were corrected and archived in the sRGB IEC611966-2.1 color-space.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Using ArcMap 10.3 software, the JPEG2000 image was georeferenced to common points located on the following vector shapefiles: ESRI Data and Maps 2010 World Water Bodies (1:250,000) and OpenStreetMap Roads vector data [downloaded 4/13/2015 from BBBike.org: http://www.bbbike.org/ ("Map data (c) OpenStreetMap contributors, CC-BY-SA" http://www.openstreetmap.org/ ; http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/ )].  The image was georeferenced to the same geographic coordinate system as the vector data: World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84) coordinate system.   A world file (.j2w) was automatically generated and saved in association with the image.  See 'Horizontal Accuracy' for the Root Mean Squared (RMS) error of this image.  Please note that the projection will need to be defined by the user in order to display the image with other projected data and the world file will need to be stored in the same root directory as the image.</procdesc>

      <eaover>The indexes reference a color palette of RGB values from 0 through 255, representing the color value from the original paper sheet map. The colors on that sheet can represent relief, drainage, vegetation, populated places, cultural features, coastal hydrography, transportation features (roads, railroads, tracks and trails), spot elevations and boundaries. The colors are sometimes explained in a legend that is incorporated into the map inset or collar.</eaover>
