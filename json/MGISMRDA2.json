  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer represents linework from the USGS 1:100,000 Roads Digital Line Graphs (DLGs) with additional linework from the Massachusetts Highway Department (MHD). Many of the new roads were provided to MHD by municipalities on various town-scale maps. Also, MHD made edits to existing DLG features, in many cases using the MassGIS 1:5,000 digital orthophotography as a backdrop to better spatially position the linework. In addition, this layer includes extensive attribute information maintained by the MHD which has been linked to all features. The layer is up-to-date through 2001. By late 2003 the linework in this datalayer will be replaced with 1:5,000 Road Centerlines that were interpreted as part of the Digital Orthophoto development project. The MHD inventory and street attribute data will then be attached (conflated) to the larger-scale mapping.",
