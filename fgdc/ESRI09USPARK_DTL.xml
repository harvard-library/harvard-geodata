        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted the data set from Tele Atlas StreetMap Premium v. 11.1. Deleted the Canada features. Dissolved out county and state boundaries. Manually merged large polygons of same park features that crossed state boundaries. Added attribute SQMI and calculated its values. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>This layer was originally downloaded from the ESRI Data and Maps and Streetmap North America 9.3.1 (2009 Data Update) DVD.  The file was stored in an SDC (Smart Data Compression) format on the DVD.
