        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Converted to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). Added features for Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico from the ESRI Data &amp; Maps 2002 U.S. 107th Congressional Districts. Corrected attribute value consistency problems. Replaced the entire outer boundary of the continental U.S. (coastlines and international) with features from the U.S. 107th Congressional Districts. Generalized to a tolerance of 0.0003 decimal degrees. Created region (multi-poly) features based on the four-digit state/district id. Then formatted the attributes to match the common attributes in the U.S. 107th Congressional Districts. The values for the attributes, NAME and PARTY, were completed from The Associated Press and National Committee for an Effective Congress. In two records, the winner was still undecided, and the NAME and PARTY attributes were coded with "TBD". Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC.</procdesc>
