      <abstract>U.S. Geographic Names Information System Churches represents the Federal standard for geographic nomenclature and contains information about the proper names and locations of physical and cultural geographic features located throughout the United States and its Territories. The U.S. Geological Survey developed the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) for the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, a Federal inter-agency body chartered by public law to maintain uniform feature name usage throughout the Government and to promulgate standard names to the public.</abstract>
      <purpose>Geographic Names Information System, of which U.S. Geographic Names Information System Churches is a part, is the official repository of domestic geographic names data; the official vehicle for geographic names use by all departments of the Federal Government; and the source for applying geographic names to Federal electronic and printed products of all types in the United States. The feature locative information has been used in emergency preparedness, marketing, site-selection and analysis, genealogical and historical research, and transportation routing applications.</purpose>

        <procdesc>GNIS Phase I data compilation and edit - Feature name and attribute data were collected from the largest-scale USGS topographic maps available. These data were compared to the records of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. This phase is complete.
 
GNIS Phase II data compilation and edit - Feature name and attribute data are collected from official state and local sources and other approved sources including historical maps and documents. This phase is not complete.
 
GNIS Maintenance program - Federal and state maintenance cooperators submit new and corrected data in conjunction with their mapping and geographical information system data maintenance programs. The GNIS has an active data gathering and maintenance program. A web-based data entry and edit application allows authorized users to submit transaction data directly for validation and entry into the database, where it immediately becomes available to all web services and applications. A test and demonstration site is available. Government agencies at all levels are encouraged to join this program. Other organizations and individuals will be considered on a case basis.
 
Partnerships - the Geographic Names Project enters into partnerships with State names authorities and State and local GIS agencies to integrate name, location, and attribute data in the GNIS with State and local datasets. These partnerships utilize GIS and web technology to automate and simplify data maintenance, ensure data consistency, integrity, and accuracy, and meet the requirements of the Board on Geographic Names for national names standardization. Government agencies at all levels are encouraged to join this program. Other organizations and individuals will be considered on a case basis.</procdesc>

Converted the file (containing latitude and longitude coordinates) to a shapefile in ArcMap?. Re-projected Alaska and Hawaii to improve their alignment. Reselected out the nine GNIS data sets based on their class types. Removed features with incorrect coordinates and whose NAME contains the word 'Squaw'. Added the STCTYFIPS fields and populated them using source STATE and COUNTY fields. Adjusted the widths of the NAME fields. Converted the data sets to SDC. Created their ArcGIS layer files (.lyr), projection files (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
