Covers Maine and portions of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, the provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, Canada. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM Zone 19N, meters, NAD 83). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, or other information associated with the principal map.
