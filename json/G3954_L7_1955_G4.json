  "dc_description_s": "This layer is a georeferenced raster image of the historic, topographic paper map entitled: Louisville and vicinity : prepared in cooperation with city, county, and state agencies, mapped by the Geological Survey and the Army Map Service. It was edited and published by the Geological Survey in 1957. Ed. of 1955. Scale 1:24,000. The image inside the map neatline is georeferenced to the surface of the earth and fit to the Kentucky North State Plane NAD 1927 coordinate system (in Feet) (Fipszone 1601). All map collar and inset information is also available as part of the raster image, including any inset maps, profiles, statistical tables, directories, text, illustrations, index maps, legends, or other information associated with the principal map. This is a typical topographic map portraying both natural and manmade features. It shows and names works of nature, such as mountains, valleys, lakes, rivers, vegetation, etc. It also identify the principal works of humans, such as roads, railroads, boundaries, transmission lines, major buildings, etc. Relief is shown with standard contour intervals of 10 feet (with 5 foot supplementary intervals). This layer is part of a selection of digitally scanned and georeferenced historic maps from The Harvard Map Collection as part of the Imaging the Urban Environment project. Maps selected for this project represent major urban areas and cities of the world, at various time periods. These maps typically portray both natural and manmade features at a large scale. The selection represents a range of regions, originators, ground condition dates, scales, and purposes.",
