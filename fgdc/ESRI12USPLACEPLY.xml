  <dataqual>
    <logic>The shapefile is converted to SDC (Smart Data Compression) format using tools in ArcGIS.  The SDC data set is then imported into a file geodatabase to verify, validate, and if needed repair the geometry.</logic>
    <complete>After processing, the data set is checked for drawing display and number of records and file sizes compared with source materials.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The positional accuracy of TIGER/Line varies with the source materials used. In areas where the Census Bureau has not realigned street features as part of MTAIP it meets, at best, the established National Map Accuracy standards (approximately +/-50 meters or 167 feet) where 1:100,000-scale maps from the USGS were the source. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of feature changes added by its field staff or local updates or of features derived from the GBF/DIME-Files or other sources. Thus, the level of positional accuracy in the TIGER/Line shapefiles may not be suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by Esri: Started with the Places data set from 2010 Census TIGER/Line Shapefiles. Projected the data set to World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS 1984). Clipped to the coastline with Data &amp; Maps 2012 U.S. States. Added field CLASS and calculated its values from values removed from the NAME field. Attached and formatted the fields from 2010 Census Summary File 1 and Esri Data. Added field POP_CLASS and calculated its population ranges based on POP2010. Added field SQMI and calculated its values projected to Albers Equal Area. Added and calculated POP10_SQMI with new SQMI values. Reordered and renamed the fields. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
