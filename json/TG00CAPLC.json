  "dc_description_s": "This datalayer displays the Census Places for the state based on the ground condition of January 1, 1990. Places, for the reporting of decennial census data, include census designated places, consolidated cities, and incorporated places. Each place is assigned a five-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code, based on the alphabetical order of the place name within each state. The FIPS place code uniquely identifies a place within a state. If place names are duplicated within a state and they represent distinctly different areas, a separate code is assigned to each place name alphabetically by primary county in which each place is located; or if both places are in the same county, alphabetically by their legal descriptions (for example, 'city' before 'village'). Legal entities which may be represented in this datalayer include: Census Designated Place (CDP). Census designated places (CDPs) are delineated for each decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide census data for concentrations of population, housing, and commercial structures that are identifiable by name but are not within an incorporated place. CDP boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with state, local, and tribal officials. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or other legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. Consolidated Cities A consolidated government is a unit of local government for which the functions of an incorporated place and its county or minor civil division (MCD) have merged. The legal aspects of this action may result in both the primary incorporated place and the county or MCD continuing to exist as legal entities, even though the county or MCD performs few or no governmental functions and has few or no elected officials. Where this occurs, and where one or more other incorporated places in the county or MCD continue to function as separate governments, even though they have been included in the consolidated government, the primary incorporated place is referred to as a 'consolidated city.' The U.S. Census Bureau classifies the separately incorporated places within the consolidated city as place entities and creates a separate place (balance) record for the portion of the consolidated city not within any other place. Consolidated cities are represented in the TIGER/Line files by a 5-character numeric FIPS code Incorporated Place. Incorporated places are those reported to the U.S. Census Bureau as legally in existence on January 1, 1990, under the laws of their respective states. An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division, which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place can be a city, city and borough, borough, municipality, town, village, or rarely, undesignated. But, for census purposes, incorporated places exclude: - The boroughs in Alaska (treated as statistical equivalents of counties) - Towns in the New England States, New York, and Wisconsin (treated as MCDs) - The boroughs in New York (treated as MCDs) - The balance portions of consolidated cities (statistical equivalents of incorporated places) - The incorporated places known as 'independent cities' in Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia (treated as statistical equivalents of counties). Statistical Entities Census Designated Places (CDPs) CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the state in which they are located. The boundaries usually are defined in cooperation with local or tribal officials. These boundaries, which usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or a other legal entity boundary, have no legal status, nor do these places have officials elected to serve traditional municipal functions. CDP boundaries may change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. There are no population size requirements for CDPs for Census 2000. For the 1990 and previous censuses, the U.S. Census Bureau required CDPs to qualify on the basis of various minimum population size criteria. Hawaii is the only state that has no incorporated places recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau. All places shown in the Census 2000 data products for Hawaii are CDPs. By agreement with the State of Hawaii, the U.S. Census Bureau does not show data separately for the city of Honolulu, which is coextensive with Honolulu County. In Puerto Rico, which also does not have incorporated places, the U.S. Census Bureau recognizes only CDPs. The CDPs in Puerto Rico are called comunidades or zonas urbanas. Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands also have only CDPs.",
