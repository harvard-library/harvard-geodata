      <abstract>U.S. Geographic Names Information System Hospitals represents an automated inventory of the proper names and locations of physical and cultural geographic features located throughout the United States and its Territories.</abstract>
      <purpose>Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), of which U.S. Geographic Names Information System Hospitals is a part, promotes geographic feature name standardization and serves as the Federal Government's repository of information regarding feature name spellings and applications for features in United States and its Territories. The names listed in the inventory can be published on Federal maps, charts, and in other documents.  The feature locative information has been used in emergency preparedness, marketing, site-selection and analysis, genealogical and historical research, and transportation routing applications.</purpose>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>GNIS was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN) to promote the standardization of feature names. GNIS is being compiled in phases.

The first phase is complete for the entire United States, and entailed the collection of names from Federal sources including large-scale USGS topographic maps, Office of Coast Survey charts, U.S. Forest Service maps, and digital datasets distributed by the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. These data are compared to the records of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names.

The second phase of data collection is complete or in progress for about 80% of the United States, and captures names from State, locally, and other published current and historical maps, charts, and texts.

GNIS Maintenance program - Federal and state maintenance cooperators submit new and corrected data in conjunction with their mapping and geographical information system data maintenance programs. Data is submitted using web data entry and edit forms and batch file processes.

National Map partnerships - As part of The USGS National Map program, the Geographic Names Office enters into partnerships with state names authorities and state and local GIS agencies to integrate vertically name, location, and attribute data in the GNIS with state and local datasets. These partnerships utilize GIS and web technology to automate and simplify data maintenance, ensure data consistency, integrity, and accuracy, and meet the goals of the Board on Geographic Names for national names standardization.

In both processes, a random sample of 10% of the entries in the system were visually verified against the compilation source data (large-scale USGS topographic maps) to ensure an attribute accuracy rate of at least 95%. Locative references (geographic coordinates, topographic map, and county) were crosschecked for logical consistency.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded each tabular file from http://geonames.usgs.gov/stategaz/index.html, generated ArcInfo coverages from the latitude/longitude coordinate attributes, and assembled all into a nationwide coverage. Reselected the feature type from the TYPE attribute. Converted to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). Removed features with incorrect coordinates. Adjusted the width of the NAME attribute. Reformatted the attributes and removed unnecessary ones. Added the LABEL_FLAG attribute and calculated its values. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
