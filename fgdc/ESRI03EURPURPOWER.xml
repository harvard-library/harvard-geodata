    <descript>
      <abstract>Europe Province/State Purchasing Power represents 752 regions of Europe. The regions are based on country-specific governing levels. Purchasing power is determined by comparing the region with the country and European average, and according to the regional share of that country's purchasing power.</abstract>
      <purpose>Europe Province/State Purchasing Power provides purchasing power information for Europe.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Largest scale when displaying the data: 1:25,000.</supplinf>
