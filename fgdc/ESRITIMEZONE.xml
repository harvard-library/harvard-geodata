        <procdesc>This data set was created from several sources and finalized.  Most features are based on a generalized version of the ArcWorld 1:3M coverage.  The country and administrative unit boundaries were utilized for most of the zone boundaries.  In a few instances, the ArcUSA 1:2M county level data for the United States and the ArcAtlas data for some zone boundaries in Russia were used.  Most of the zones in ocean areas followed lines of longitude and latitude and were mathematically generated.  The values of plus and minus hours from Greenwich are from a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) map and the Rand McNally New International Atlas.</procdesc>

Generalized to a tolerance of 0.25 miles.  Edited Nunavut boundaries from Government of Nunavut and Nunavut Planning Commission sources and Saskatchewan boundaries from National Research Council Canada and the Institute for National Measurement Standards.  Created ArcGIS(tm) layer file (.lyr).  Created ArcView legend file (.avl).  Created projection file (.prj).  Ran ArcView Avenue request ExportClean, and created spatial indices.</procdesc>
