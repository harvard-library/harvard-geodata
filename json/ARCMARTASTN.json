  "dc_description_s": "This point datalayer depicts MARTA Rail stations with associated attribute data for the Atlanta Regional Commission's (ARC) 10-county region. ARC documentation states that: This Theme was originally created using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology where rail stations were captured as point locations at adjacent drives or parking lots. For the purpose of this CD, ARC's GIS Division adjusted many of the points to coincide with MARTA rail lines and bus routes, and to improve the positional accuracy against the 1993 Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quad (DOQQ) imagery. ARC also used 1999 digital imagery for improved positional accuracy of the new North Line stations at Sandy Springs and North Springs.",
