      <abstract>World Wildlife Fund Terrestrial Ecoregions represents global terrestrial ecoregions. Ecoregions are defined as relatively large areas of land or water in the world containing a characteristic set of natural communities that share a large majority of their species, dynamics, and environmental conditions. This data set contains all terrestrial ecoregions, which include those of the Global 200. Global 200 ecoregions are a collection of the Earth's most outstanding and diverse terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitats where the Earth's biological wealth is most distinctive and rich, where its loss will be most severely felt, and we must protect if we are to preserve the web of life. For more information, contact http://www.worldwildlife.org.</abstract>
      <purpose>World Wildlife Fund Terrestrial Ecoregions provides a global view of terrestrial ecoregions defined by the World Wildlife Fund Conservation Science Program, and can be used for geographic display and analysis at national and world levels.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Largest scale when displaying the data: 1:3,000,000.</supplinf>

        <procdesc>The data set was updated for 2005.

[2001] We began by accepting the biogeographic realms of Pielou (1979) and Udvardy (1975) and modifying the biome systems of Dinerstein et al. (1995) and Ricketts et al. (1999). We then consulted existing global maps of floristic or zoogeographic provinces, global and regional maps of units based on the distribution of selected groups of plants and animals, the world's biotic province maps, and global maps of broad vegetation types. These were useful for evaluating the extent of realms and biomes, the first two tiers in our hierarchical classification. 

We then identified published regional classification systems to be used as a baseline for ecoregion boundaries. Data and consultations from regional experts were also important for final ecoregion delineations.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded the data set from World Wildlife Fund's FTP site. Removed attributes ECO_ID, ECO_CODE, ECO_SYM, G200_REGION, G200_BIOME, and G200_STAT. Renamed attribute GBL_STAT to STATUS. Adjusted the order and field widths of attributes. Added BIOME_DESC populating it with BIOME's descriptions. Added PRIORITY populating it with 'Yes' for every feature where G200_NUM is greater than zero. Deleted records where ECO_NAME = "". Made the features multi-part based on all attributes and reduced the record count from 14942 to 832.Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>

        <enttypd>The polygons represent global terrestrial ecoregions defined as relatively large areas of land in the world that share a large majority of their species, dynamics, and environmental conditions. Ecoregions function effectively as conservation units because they encompass similar biological communities and because their boundaries roughly coincide with the area over which key ecological processes most strongly interact. These features can help conservation planners better achieve representation and persistence of biodiversity when developing conservation strategies for individual ecoregions.</enttypd>
