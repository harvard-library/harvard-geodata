    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was extracted from the 1990 Census Version TIGER/Line(tm) files (CD-ROM edition).  The positional accuracy of the TIGER/Line coordinates varies with the source materials used but at best meets the established National Map Accuracy standards (+/- 167 feet approximately) where 1:100,000-scale maps from the USGS are the source. The Census Bureau cannot specify the accuracy of feature updates added by its field staff or of features derived from the GBF/DIME-Files or other map sources. Thus, the level of positional accuracy in the TIGER/Line files is not suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>How GDT Creates These Files: The data included in the boundary files was extracted from the 1990 Census Version TIGER/Line files (CD-ROM edition). Once extracted, the County, Tract, and Block Group information was edited as one database, assuring that they have perfect overlay characteristics where appropriate. When all editing was complete, the different layers were separated into products.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted data sets from GDT Dynamap/2000 v9.0.  Divided into individual states.  Added demographic attributes from Summary Tape File-1A (STF-1A) data published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census based on the 1990 Census of Population.  Converted to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).  Recalculated any attributes based on area.  Created ArcGIS(tm) layer file (.lyr).  Created ArcView legend file (.avl).  Created projection file (.prj).  Ran ArcView Avenue request ExportClean, and created spatial indices.</procdesc>

        <enttypd>The polygons represent U.S. Census block groups within Minnesota. A block group is a combination of census blocks that is a subdivision of a census tract or block numbering area. A block group consists of all blocks whose numbers begin with the same digit in a given census tract or block numbering area. The block group is the lowest level of geography for which the Census Bureau has tabulated sample data in the 1990 census.</enttypd>
