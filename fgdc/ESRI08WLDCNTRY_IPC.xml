    <descript>
      <abstract>This polygon layer joins the ESRI World Census IPC Demographics attribute table to the ESRI Data &amp; Maps 2008 : World Countries datalayer, to enable spatial displaying of World Census IPC Demographics attributes.

World Census IPC Demographics (table) represents a vast amount of recent demographic information for the countries recognized by the U.S. State Department.</abstract>
      <purpose>World Census IPC Demographics (table) provides demographic and vital events factors for the countries of the world. To display Census IPC Demographics attributes on a map, join this table to a World Countries attribute table using FIPS_CNTRY or CNTRY_NAME as the common attribute.</purpose>

Compiled 30 attributes covering demographic and vital events factors from the U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division/International Programs Center and the CIA The World Factbook web sites. Removed unwanted attributes and sorted on FIPS_CNTRY. Converted the data set to a SDC table and created an ArcGIS layer file (.lyr).</procdesc>
