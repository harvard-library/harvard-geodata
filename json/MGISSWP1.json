  "dc_description_s": "The datalayer contains the majority of the facilities currently regulated under DEP's solid waste regulations (310 CMR 16.00 & 19.00). The 579 polygons in the datalayer include thirteen specific types of solid waste facilities. Please Note: Although the majority of the polygons represent landfills, only a small fraction of those landfills are active. In addition, this datalayer does not contain all solid waste facilities known to DEP. The MassGIS land-use datalayer has waste site and mining classifications which may represent landfills not in the solid waste datalayer.",
