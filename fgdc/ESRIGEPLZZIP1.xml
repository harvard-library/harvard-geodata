    <descript>
      <abstract>There are no official zip code areas in Germany.  Zip codes are related only to streets but the first digit of their zip codes are organized into ten zones that cover Germany.  Germany One-Digit Zip Code Zones (PLZgrenzen) represent these ten areas.</abstract>
      <purpose>Germany One-Digit Zip Code Zones (PLZgrenzen) provides the ten zones of Germany that each encloses all streets with the same first digit of their zip codes.</purpose>

        <procdesc>There are no official zip code areas in Germany. Zip codes (Postleitzahl, PLZ) are only related to streets.  To build the areas called zones, ESRI Geoinformatik GmbH digitized from topographic maps using community boundaries where possible, digitized from street lines inside cities and communities containing several zip codes, and used free interpretation.</procdesc>

Created ArcGIS(tm) layer file (.lyr).  Created ArcView legend file (.avl).  Created projection file (.prj).  Ran ArcView Avenue request ExportClean, and created spatial indices.</procdesc>
