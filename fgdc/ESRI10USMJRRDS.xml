In some areas, accuracy is off by up to several tens of meters (100 feet or more). In the poorest areas, accuracy is off by up to 100 meters (328 feet).</horizpar>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted the U.S. major road features from Tele Atlas MultiNet North America v. 2010.03. Deleted unnecessary fields. Added field FRC_DESC and copied its values from MultiNet FRC descriptions. Added field SHIELD and calculated its values based on MultiNet RTETYP equivalents. Renamed field SHIELDNUM to HWY_NUM. Converted the data set to SDC. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
