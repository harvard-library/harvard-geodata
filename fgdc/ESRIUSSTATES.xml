        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was extracted from the ArcUSA 1:25M database, then generalized.  Generalizing reduces positional accuracy and the tolerance was not recorded so the positional accuracy exceeds that of the ArcUSA data set.  The positional accuracy of the ArcUSA 1:25M data set is 1792 meters which is based on generalizing-to a tolerance of 500 meters-the 1:2,000,000-scale USGS Digital Line Graph (DLG) source data.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted and generalized the features from ArcUSA 1:25M.  Added demographic attributes from Summary Tape File-1A (STF-1A) data published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census based on the 1990 Census of Population. Added farm attributes from data published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census based on the 1987 Census of Agriculture.  Added Pop2000 attribute from CACI International, Inc.  Converted to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) by splitting the United States into-if present: Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands-and the 48 contiguous states (including District of Columbia); converting each to NAD83; then merging them together.  Recalculated any attributes based on area.  Created ArcGIS(tm) layer file (.lyr).  Created ArcView legend file (.avl).  Created projection file (.prj).  Ran ArcView Avenue request ExportClean, and created spatial indices.</procdesc>
