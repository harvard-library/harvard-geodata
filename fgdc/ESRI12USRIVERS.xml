        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by Esri: Extracted and generalized the features from ArcWorld 1:3M.  Added Name and System attribute values from the Rand McNally New International Atlas, the Times Atlas of the World, and the Digital Chart of the World.  Converted to North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) by splitting the United States into-if present: Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands-and the 48 contiguous states (including District of Columbia); converting each to NAD83; then merging them together. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr).  Created projection file (.prj).  Ran ArcView GIS Avenue? request ExportClean, and created spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC.</procdesc>
