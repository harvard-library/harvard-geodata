    <descript>
      <abstract>U.S. Major Highways represents the major highways of the United States. These include Interstates, US Highways, State Highways and major roads. This dataset is a subset of the Streets dataset. It contains all Class 1 and 2 roads segments plus any other roads segments necessary to provide network connectivity for the Class_Rte field.</abstract>
      <purpose>U.S. Major Highways provides a subset of highways and major roads from the very detailed Streets dataset for national, state, and regional display.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Largest scale when displaying the data: 1:100,000.</supplinf>

    <logic>No duplicate features are present. The shapefile is converted to SDC (Smart Data Compression) format in ArcSDE. This verifies and validates the geometry.</logic>
    <complete>After processing, the data set is checked for drawing display and number of records and file sizes compared with source materials.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was extracted from the 2000 Census TIGER/Line files. The positional accuracy varies with the source materials used, but generally the information is no better than the established national map Accuracy standards for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). To improve the accuracy, GDT ran a process against the entire nationwide database.

The level of positional accuracy in the StreetMap files is not suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface.</horizpar>
