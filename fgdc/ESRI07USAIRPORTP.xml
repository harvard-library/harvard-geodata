    <descript>
      <abstract>U.S. Airports represents airport boundaries and airport runways within the United States. All airports have a boundary and most have at least one runway.</abstract>
      <purpose>U.S. Airports provides the boundaries for thousands of airports and runways. There are many attributes that describe each airport, for example, three or four character location id (airport code), owner, elevation, congestion level, large certified air carrier enplanements, foreign enplanements, hub size, and tower type.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Largest scale when displaying the data: 1:100,000.</supplinf>

        <procdesc>Airport data was merged from the following four Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) landing facilities databases:
National Flight Data Center (NFDC) database for February 1994; National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS) database, current as of May 1994; Air Carrier Activity Information System (ACAIS) database for calendar year 1992; Terminal Area Forecast (TAF) for fiscal year 1991.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Extracted the data set from Tele Atlas StreetMap Premium v. 9.0.  Deleted all Canada features. Merged all multi-polygon runway and airport features into one runway and one airport feature per individual U.S. airport. Removed all values from the attribute NAME for runways (FCC = D59) to prevent duplicate labeling. Attached and formatted the attributes from 2006 U.S. Airports.  Put a "-999" value into all records that did not find a match for the attribute ELEVATION.  Put a "0" value into all records that did not find a match for the attributes LRGCERTENP, COMM_ENP, AIRTAXIENP, FOREIGNENP and INTRANENP.  Insured the values in the NAME attribute were title case.  Converted the data set to SDC.  Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
