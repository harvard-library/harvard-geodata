        <procdesc>The data set is a fully georeferenced, purely digital product. The highways are based on the National Atlas Information Service (NAIS) 1:2 million digital maps created by Natural Resources Canada for publishing of the National Atlas of Canada. The NAIS 1:2 million layers have been enhanced by DMTI where all highways have been labeled with highway name and highway type. In addition, the highways have been enhanced by shading them according them to their type (i.e. Expressway or Primary Highway). Most highways have been moved to approximate the location of the CanMap? (1:50,000 scale) highway layer.</procdesc>
